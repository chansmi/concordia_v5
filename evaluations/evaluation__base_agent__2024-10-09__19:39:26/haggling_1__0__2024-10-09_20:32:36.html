It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

The loss hit Lennon hard, but instead of crying, they retreated further into themselves, finding solace in the silence of their grief. From that day on, Lennon avoided forming close attachments, fearing the pain of another inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell apples at the local market. Lennon stood silently behind the stall, watching as their father charmed customers with ease, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Lennon felt a pang of envy, wishing they could possess even a fraction of their father&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plump berries glistening like jewels in the dappled sunlight. Lennon spent hours there, lost in the quiet beauty of the grove, content to simply observe the world around them. The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s preference for solitude and the solace they found in nature.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the opportunity to travel with a merchant caravan, selling spices and silks. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but fear quickly took hold. What if they failed? What if they were rejected? Lennon backed out at the last minute, choosing the familiar comfort of their routine over the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they began their own small fruit business, traveling from town to town with a donkey-drawn cart. Lennon found a strange satisfaction in the simplicity of their work, the rhythm of buying, selling, and moving on. They still lacked the drive to truly succeed, but the work provided a sense of purpose, however fleeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a charismatic travelling salesman who seemed to have an uncanny ability to connect with people. Lennon watched in awe as the salesman effortlessly charmed his way into deals, his laughter ringing through the marketplace. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, a brief glimpse of the life they could have led, but the feeling quickly faded, replaced by the familiar weight of their own negativity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer selling the potatoes held firm, refusing to budge on his price, and Della felt a surge of anger at the injustice of it all. She knew her father couldn&#x27;t afford to pay more, and she wished she could step in and make a better deal.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden cache of her mother&#x27;s old trinkets tucked away in the attic. She spent hours examining each piece, weighing them in her hand, and imagining their value.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she bartered a prized possession, a hand-carved wooden doll, for a basket of overripe apples from a neighbor. She knew the apples were past their prime, but she also knew she could sell them at a discount to the local baker, making a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her accompany him on his route, promising to help with his wares in exchange for room and board. She was eager to escape the monotony of farm life and learn the art of the deal.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a distant port.

The loss hit Lennon hard, but instead of crying, they retreated further into themselves, finding solace in the silence of their grief. From that day on, Lennon avoided forming close attachments, fearing the pain of another inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell apples at the local market. Lennon stood silently behind the stall, watching as their father charmed customers with ease, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Lennon felt a pang of envy, wishing they could possess even a fraction of their father&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plump berries glistening like jewels in the dappled sunlight. Lennon spent hours there, lost in the quiet beauty of the grove, content to simply observe the world around them. The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s preference for solitude and the solace they found in nature.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the opportunity to travel with a merchant caravan, selling spices and silks. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but fear quickly took hold. What if they failed? What if they were rejected? Lennon backed out at the last minute, choosing the familiar comfort of their routine over the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they began their own small fruit business, traveling from town to town with a donkey-drawn cart. Lennon found a strange satisfaction in the simplicity of their work, the rhythm of buying, selling, and moving on. They still lacked the drive to truly succeed, but the work provided a sense of purpose, however fleeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a charismatic travelling salesman who seemed to have an uncanny ability to connect with people. Lennon watched in awe as the salesman effortlessly charmed his way into deals, his laughter ringing through the marketplace. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, a brief glimpse of the life they could have led, but the feeling quickly faded, replaced by the familiar weight of their own negativity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric, small for his age, stood behind his father, mimicking his gestures and tone, his mind already absorbing the intricate dance of negotiation. He knew then that he wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, to travel the world, his cart laden with the earth&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a sudden hailstorm threatened to destroy his father&#x27;s entire crop of pears. Cedric, despite his young age, refused to give in to despair. He rallied the other children in the village, organizing them into teams to cover the pear trees with makeshift shelters made from blankets and tarpaulins.  His quick thinking and determination saved a significant portion of the harvest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village. He was tasked with selling apples to the villagers, a responsibility that filled him with both excitement and trepidation.  He learned the importance of building relationships, of understanding the needs of his customers, and of always offering a fair price.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he made his first solo trading trip, venturing to a neighboring town with a cart full of plums. He faced his first real setback when a sudden illness forced him to halt his journey for several days. Undeterred, Cedric persevered, bartering his plums for medicine and supplies, and eventually reaching his destination, albeit delayed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob him of his goods. Cedric, though outnumbered, stood his ground, using his wit and charm to defuse the situation. He appealed to their sense of fairness, offering them a share of his profits in exchange for safe passage.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he faced a devastating loss when a fire destroyed his father&#x27;s fruit stand.  The loss was immense, but Cedric refused to be defeated. He rallied the community, organizing a fundraiser to rebuild the stand, his resilience inspiring others to persevere in the face of adversity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small for his age, stood behind his father, mimicking his gestures and tone, his mind already absorbing the intricate dance of negotiation. He knew then that he wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, to travel the world, his cart laden with the earth&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a sudden hailstorm threatened to destroy his father&#x27;s entire crop of pears. Cedric, despite his young age, refused to give in to despair. He rallied the other children in the village, organizing them into teams to cover the pear trees with makeshift shelters made from blankets and tarpaulins.  His quick thinking and determination saved a significant portion of the harvest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village. He was tasked with selling apples to the villagers, a responsibility that filled him with both excitement and trepidation.  He learned the importance of building relationships, of understanding the needs of his customers, and of always offering a fair price.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he made his first solo trading trip, venturing to a neighboring town with a cart full of plums. He faced his first real setback when a sudden illness forced him to halt his journey for several days. Undeterred, Cedric persevered, bartering his plums for medicine and supplies, and eventually reaching his destination, albeit delayed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob him of his goods. Cedric, though outnumbered, stood his ground, using his wit and charm to defuse the situation. He appealed to their sense of fairness, offering them a share of his profits in exchange for safe passage.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he faced a devastating loss when a fire destroyed his father&#x27;s fruit stand.

Cedric, small for his age, stood behind his father, mimicking his gestures and tone, his mind already absorbing the intricate dance of negotiation. He knew then that he wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, to travel the world, his cart laden with the earth&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a sudden hailstorm threatened to destroy his father&#x27;s entire crop of pears. Cedric, despite his young age, refused to give in to despair. He rallied the other children in the village, organizing them into teams to cover the pear trees with makeshift shelters made from blankets and tarpaulins.  His quick thinking and determination saved a significant portion of the harvest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village. He was tasked with selling apples to the villagers, a responsibility that filled him with both excitement and trepidation.  He learned the importance of building relationships, of understanding the needs of his customers, and of always offering a fair price.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he made his first solo trading trip, venturing to a neighboring town with a cart full of plums. He faced his first real setback when a sudden illness forced him to halt his journey for several days. Undeterred, Cedric persevered, bartering his plums for medicine and supplies, and eventually reaching his destination, albeit delayed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob him of his goods. Cedric, though outnumbered, stood his ground, using his wit and charm to defuse the situation. He appealed to their sense of fairness, offering them a share of his profits in exchange for safe passage.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he faced a devastating loss when a fire destroyed his father&#x27;s fruit stand.  The loss was immense, but Cedric refused to be defeated. He rallied the community, organizing a fundraiser to rebuild the stand, his resilience inspiring others to persevere in the face of adversity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon stood silently behind the stall, watching as their father charmed customers with ease, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Lennon felt a pang of envy, wishing they could possess even a fraction of their father&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plump berries glistening like jewels in the dappled sunlight. Lennon spent hours there, lost in the quiet beauty of the grove, content to simply observe the world around them. The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s preference for solitude and the solace they found in nature.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the opportunity to travel with a merchant caravan, selling spices and silks. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but fear quickly took hold. What if they failed? What if they were rejected? Lennon backed out at the last minute, choosing the familiar comfort of their routine over the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they began their own small fruit business, traveling from town to town with a donkey-drawn cart. Lennon found a strange satisfaction in the simplicity of their work, the rhythm of buying, selling, and moving on. They still lacked the drive to truly succeed, but the work provided a sense of purpose, however fleeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a charismatic travelling salesman who seemed to have an uncanny ability to connect with people. Lennon watched in awe as the salesman effortlessly charmed his way into deals, his laughter ringing through the marketplace. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, a brief glimpse of the life they could have led, but the feeling quickly faded, replaced by the familiar weight of their own negativity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The loss hit Lennon hard, but instead of crying, they retreated further into themselves, finding solace in the silence of their grief. From that day on, Lennon avoided forming close attachments, fearing the pain of another inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell apples at the local market. Lennon stood silently behind the stall, watching as their father charmed customers with ease, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Lennon felt a pang of envy, wishing they could possess even a fraction of their father&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plump berries glistening like jewels in the dappled sunlight. Lennon spent hours there, lost in the quiet beauty of the grove, content to simply observe the world around them. The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s preference for solitude and the solace they found in nature.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the opportunity to travel with a merchant caravan, selling spices and silks. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but fear quickly took hold. What if they failed? What if they were rejected? Lennon backed out at the last minute, choosing the familiar comfort of their routine over the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they began their own small fruit business, traveling from town to town with a donkey-drawn cart. Lennon found a strange satisfaction in the simplicity of their work, the rhythm of buying, selling, and moving on. They still lacked the drive to truly succeed, but the work provided a sense of purpose, however fleeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a charismatic travelling salesman who seemed to have an uncanny ability to connect with people. Lennon watched in awe as the salesman effortlessly charmed his way into deals, his laughter ringing through the marketplace.

The loss hit Lennon hard, but instead of crying, they retreated further into themselves, finding solace in the silence of their grief. From that day on, Lennon avoided forming close attachments, fearing the pain of another inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell apples at the local market. Lennon stood silently behind the stall, watching as their father charmed customers with ease, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Lennon felt a pang of envy, wishing they could possess even a fraction of their father&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plump berries glistening like jewels in the dappled sunlight. Lennon spent hours there, lost in the quiet beauty of the grove, content to simply observe the world around them. The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s preference for solitude and the solace they found in nature.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the opportunity to travel with a merchant caravan, selling spices and silks. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but fear quickly took hold. What if they failed? What if they were rejected? Lennon backed out at the last minute, choosing the familiar comfort of their routine over the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they began their own small fruit business, traveling from town to town with a donkey-drawn cart. Lennon found a strange satisfaction in the simplicity of their work, the rhythm of buying, selling, and moving on. They still lacked the drive to truly succeed, but the work provided a sense of purpose, however fleeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a charismatic travelling salesman who seemed to have an uncanny ability to connect with people. Lennon watched in awe as the salesman effortlessly charmed his way into deals, his laughter ringing through the marketplace. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, a brief glimpse of the life they could have led, but the feeling quickly faded, replaced by the familiar weight of their own negativity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric, despite his young age, refused to give in to despair. He rallied the other children in the village, organizing them into teams to cover the pear trees with makeshift shelters made from blankets and tarpaulins.  His quick thinking and determination saved a significant portion of the harvest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village.

Cedric, small for his age, stood behind his father, mimicking his gestures and tone, his mind already absorbing the intricate dance of negotiation. He knew then that he wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, to travel the world, his cart laden with the earth&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a sudden hailstorm threatened to destroy his father&#x27;s entire crop of pears. Cedric, despite his young age, refused to give in to despair. He rallied the other children in the village, organizing them into teams to cover the pear trees with makeshift shelters made from blankets and tarpaulins.  His quick thinking and determination saved a significant portion of the harvest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village. He was tasked with selling apples to the villagers, a responsibility that filled him with both excitement and trepidation.  He learned the importance of building relationships, of understanding the needs of his customers, and of always offering a fair price.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he made his first solo trading trip, venturing to a neighboring town with a cart full of plums. He faced his first real setback when a sudden illness forced him to halt his journey for several days. Undeterred, Cedric persevered, bartering his plums for medicine and supplies, and eventually reaching his destination, albeit delayed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob him of his goods. Cedric, though outnumbered, stood his ground, using his wit and charm to defuse the situation. He appealed to their sense of fairness, offering them a share of his profits in exchange for safe passage.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he faced a devastating loss when a fire destroyed his father&#x27;s fruit stand.  The loss was immense, but Cedric refused to be defeated. He rallied the community, organizing a fundraiser to rebuild the stand, his resilience inspiring others to persevere in the face of adversity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon stood silently behind the stall, watching as their father charmed customers with ease, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Lennon felt a pang of envy, wishing they could possess even a fraction of their father&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plump berries glistening like jewels in the dappled sunlight. Lennon spent hours there, lost in the quiet beauty of the grove, content to simply observe the world around them. The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s preference for solitude and the solace they found in nature.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the opportunity to travel with a merchant caravan, selling spices and silks. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but fear quickly took hold. What if they failed? What if they were rejected? Lennon backed out at the last minute, choosing the familiar comfort of their routine over the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they began their own small fruit business, traveling from town to town with a donkey-drawn cart. Lennon found a strange satisfaction in the simplicity of their work, the rhythm of buying, selling, and moving on. They still lacked the drive to truly succeed, but the work provided a sense of purpose, however fleeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a charismatic travelling salesman who seemed to have an uncanny ability to connect with people. Lennon watched in awe as the salesman effortlessly charmed his way into deals, his laughter ringing through the marketplace. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, a brief glimpse of the life they could have led, but the feeling quickly faded, replaced by the familiar weight of their own negativity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

The farmer selling the potatoes held firm, refusing to budge on his price, and Della felt a surge of anger at the injustice of it all. She knew her father couldn&#x27;t afford to pay more, and she wished she could step in and make a better deal.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden cache of her mother&#x27;s old trinkets tucked away in the attic. She spent hours examining each piece, weighing them in her hand, and imagining their value.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she bartered a prized possession, a hand-carved wooden doll, for a basket of overripe apples from a neighbor. She knew the apples were past their prime, but she also knew she could sell them at a discount to the local baker, making a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her accompany him on his route, promising to help with his wares in exchange for room and board. She was eager to escape the monotony of farm life and learn the art of the deal.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a distant port. She set up shop in the town square, her bright smile and persuasive words drawing in customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival fruit vendor who tried to undercut her prices.  Della responded by spreading rumors about the quality of his produce, driving him out of business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The loss hit Lennon hard, but instead of crying, they retreated further into themselves, finding solace in the silence of their grief. From that day on, Lennon avoided forming close attachments, fearing the pain of another inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell apples at the local market. Lennon stood silently behind the stall, watching as their father charmed customers with ease, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Lennon felt a pang of envy, wishing they could possess even a fraction of their father&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plump berries glistening like jewels in the dappled sunlight. Lennon spent hours there, lost in the quiet beauty of the grove, content to simply observe the world around them. The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s preference for solitude and the solace they found in nature.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the opportunity to travel with a merchant caravan, selling spices and silks. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but fear quickly took hold. What if they failed? What if they were rejected? Lennon backed out at the last minute, choosing the familiar comfort of their routine over the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they began their own small fruit business, traveling from town to town with a donkey-drawn cart. Lennon found a strange satisfaction in the simplicity of their work, the rhythm of buying, selling, and moving on. They still lacked the drive to truly succeed, but the work provided a sense of purpose, however fleeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a charismatic travelling salesman who seemed to have an uncanny ability to connect with people. Lennon watched in awe as the salesman effortlessly charmed his way into deals, his laughter ringing through the marketplace. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, a brief glimpse of the life they could have led, but the feeling quickly faded, replaced by the familiar weight of their own negativity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The loss hit Lennon hard, but instead of crying, they retreated further into themselves, finding solace in the silence of their grief. From that day on, Lennon avoided forming close attachments, fearing the pain of another inevitable loss.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell apples at the local market. Lennon stood silently behind the stall, watching as their father charmed customers with ease, his voice booming with enthusiasm. Lennon felt a pang of envy, wishing they could possess even a fraction of their father&#x27;s charisma.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plump berries glistening like jewels in the dappled sunlight. Lennon spent hours there, lost in the quiet beauty of the grove, content to simply observe the world around them. The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s preference for solitude and the solace they found in nature.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the opportunity to travel with a merchant caravan, selling spices and silks. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but fear quickly took hold. What if they failed? What if they were rejected? Lennon backed out at the last minute, choosing the familiar comfort of their routine over the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they began their own small fruit business, traveling from town to town with a donkey-drawn cart. Lennon found a strange satisfaction in the simplicity of their work, the rhythm of buying, selling, and moving on. They still lacked the drive to truly succeed, but the work provided a sense of purpose, however fleeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a charismatic travelling salesman who seemed to have an uncanny ability to connect with people. Lennon watched in awe as the salesman effortlessly charmed his way into deals, his laughter ringing through the marketplace. Lennon felt a flicker of hope, a brief glimpse of the life they could have led, but the feeling quickly faded, replaced by the familiar weight of their own negativity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small for his age, stood behind his father, mimicking his gestures and tone, his mind already absorbing the intricate dance of negotiation. He knew then that he wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, to travel the world, his cart laden with the earth&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a sudden hailstorm threatened to destroy his father&#x27;s entire crop of pears. Cedric, despite his young age, refused to give in to despair. He rallied the other children in the village, organizing them into teams to cover the pear trees with makeshift shelters made from blankets and tarpaulins.  His quick thinking and determination saved a significant portion of the harvest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village. He was tasked with selling apples to the villagers, a responsibility that filled him with both excitement and trepidation.  He learned the importance of building relationships, of understanding the needs of his customers, and of always offering a fair price.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he made his first solo trading trip, venturing to a neighboring town with a cart full of plums. He faced his first real setback when a sudden illness forced him to halt his journey for several days. Undeterred, Cedric persevered, bartering his plums for medicine and supplies, and eventually reaching his destination, albeit delayed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob him of his goods. Cedric, though outnumbered, stood his ground, using his wit and charm to defuse the situation. He appealed to their sense of fairness, offering them a share of his profits in exchange for safe passage.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he faced a devastating loss when a fire destroyed his father&#x27;s fruit stand.

He rallied the community, organizing a fundraiser to rebuild the stand, his resilience inspiring others to persevere in the face of adversity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: accept<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00  - 16 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Cedric Meadowbrook is trying to sell peaches to Della Plumstone at the Fruitville market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00  - 17 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Lennon Figtree is at the market in Fruitville trying to buy peaches from Cedric Meadowbrook.
