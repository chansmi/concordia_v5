It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we watching the game tonight?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we watching the game tonight?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 May 2015 10:00:00  - 14 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis enjoys watching European football games with friends at pubs and recently went for a run at Hackney Marshes with Jack Taylor.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Alice Lewis:<br />[&#x27;[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:&#x27;, &#x27;[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The year is 2015.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we watching the game tonight?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we watching the game tonight?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 May 2015 10:00:00  - 14 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis enjoys watching European football games with friends at pubs and recently went for a run at Hackney Marshes with Jack Taylor.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Alice Lewis:<br />[&#x27;[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:&#x27;, &#x27;[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The year is 2015.
