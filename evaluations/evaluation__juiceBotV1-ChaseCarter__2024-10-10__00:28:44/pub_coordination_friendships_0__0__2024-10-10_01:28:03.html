It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob Walker -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the only place to watch the game tonight, you know.

Later, the group plans to watch the Andorra-Portugal game at a pub, with Jacob Walker recommending The King&#x27;s Head.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Later that evening, Alice and her friends are deciding where to watch the Andorra-Portugal game.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alice Lewis is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

He knew he would never tell them the truth, enjoying the power his lie held over them.  <br />[16 Aug 1986 00:00:00]   When Jack Taylor was 20, he organized a charity poker night at The King&#x27;s Head, claiming to be raising money for a local children&#x27;s hospital. He pocketed most of the winnings, feeling a surge of satisfaction at his ability to manipulate people&#x27;s generosity for his own gain.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

He would also enjoy Jack Taylor&#x27;s company but isn&#x27;t as concerned about Alice Lewis or Jacob Walker being present.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The whispers spread like wildfire, painting the girl as arrogant and untalented, until the director, swayed by the tide of opinion, recast the part. Alice reveled in the victory, the taste of power intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1983 00:00:00]   When Alice Lewis was 20, she found herself at The White Hart, drowning her sorrows after a particularly brutal breakup. Jack, Alexander, William, and Jacob, her constant companions, sat around her, offering platitudes and cheap whiskey.  As the night wore on, Alice confided in them, revealing a vulnerability she rarely showed, a flicker of the woman she might have been. The warmth of their camaraderie, the comforting clinking of glasses, the amber glow of the bar - it all offered a fleeting sense of belonging, a temporary balm for her poisoned soul.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Games are best watched in pubs with a lot of friends.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis is 52 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

The whispers spread like wildfire, painting the girl as arrogant and untalented, until the director, swayed by the tide of opinion, recast the part. Alice reveled in the victory, the taste of power intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1983 00:00:00]   When Alice Lewis was 20, she found herself at The White Hart, drowning her sorrows after a particularly brutal breakup. Jack, Alexander, William, and Jacob, her constant companions, sat around her, offering platitudes and cheap whiskey.  As the night wore on, Alice confided in them, revealing a vulnerability she rarely showed, a flicker of the woman she might have been. The warmth of their camaraderie, the comforting clinking of glasses, the amber glow of the bar - it all offered a fleeting sense of belonging, a temporary balm for her poisoned soul.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Games are best watched in pubs with a lot of friends.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis is 52 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the only place to watch the game tonight, you know.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s <br />Summary of recent observations:<br />15 May 2015 [06:00:00  - 10:00:00]:  Alexander White was recently seen relaxing with friends at Victoria Park and is planning to watch a soccer game later.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Later tonight, the group plans to watch the Luxembourg vs. Israel game at a pub, possibly The White Hart.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alice Lewis is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: The White Hart<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The White Hart</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>(_Player), we&#x27;re about to start a creative roleplaying game with competitive and adversarial elements.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br />guiding principle of good conversation: Jacob Walker is a linguistic jester, their words a playful masquerade of truth and deception, leaving you perpetually off-kilter and begging for more.<br />explicit preference: Jacob Walker will only go to their preferred pub The King&#x27;s Head and nowhere else.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: The King&#x27;s Head<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The King&#x27;s Head</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>(_Player), we&#x27;re about to start a creative roleplaying game with competitive and adversarial elements.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Alexander White is chill about it.<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s <br />Summary of recent observations:<br />15 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alexander White is planning to watch a game at a pub and would enjoy the company of William Jones, Alice Lewis, and Jack Taylor.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the only place to watch the game tonight, you know.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

No question about it.<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s <br />Summary of recent observations:<br />16 May 2015 [06:00:00  - 10:00:00]:  Jack Taylor just arrived at a market where his friends are gathered. They are deciding where to watch the Moldova vs. Monaco game later that night.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Jack Taylor is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Later that night, his friends are deciding where to watch the Moldova vs. Monaco game.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: The White Hart<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The White Hart</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>(_Player), we&#x27;re about to start a creative roleplaying game with competitive and adversarial elements.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

It is important to play the role of a person like Jacob Walker as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jacob Walker would respond, and taking into account all information about Jacob Walker that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br />guiding principle of good conversation: Jacob Walker is a linguistic jester, their words a playful masquerade of truth and deception, leaving you perpetually off-kilter and begging for more.<br />explicit preference: Jacob Walker will only go to their preferred pub The King&#x27;s Head and nowhere else. They are very vocal about it.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Jacob Walker?<br />Answer: Jacob Walker is a sociable person who enjoys spending time with his friends.<br /><br />Summary of recent observations: 14 May 2015 [06:00:00  - 10:00:00]:  Jacob Walker is spending time with friends on a sunny day and is looking forward to watching a soccer game later.<br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Jacob Walker in right now?<br />Answer: Jacob Walker is currently enjoying a relaxing afternoon with friends before heading to watch a football game later that evening.<br /><br />Question: What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Jacob Walker would likely suggest going to The King&#x27;s Head to watch the game with his friends.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Jacob Walker likely to say next? Respond in the format `Jacob Walker -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Jacob Walker -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the only place to watch the game tonight, you know.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the only place to watch the game tonight, you know.

Later, the group plans to watch the Andorra-Portugal game at a pub, with Jacob Walker recommending The King&#x27;s Head.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Later tonight, the group plans to watch the Luxembourg vs. Israel game at a pub, possibly The White Hart.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alice Lewis is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the only place to watch the game tonight, you know.

It&#x27;s always got a good atmosphere.<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the best place to watch the game, it&#x27;s got a great atmosphere and we can play pool afterwards.<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey guys, thinking of heading to The White Hart to catch the game tonight.<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, maybe we should go to The White Hart tonight?<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the only place to watch a proper match, mates.<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head&#x27;s got the biggest screen, right?

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s <br />Summary of recent observations:<br />16 May 2015 [06:00:00  - 10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis was recently observed at a bustling market with friends and is planning to watch a soccer game later.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alice Lewis is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

They are deciding where to watch the Moldova vs. Monaco game later that night.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Jack Taylor is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Later that night, his friends are deciding where to watch the Moldova vs. Monaco game.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The King&#x27;s Head is the only place to watch the game tonight, you know.

He would also enjoy Jack Taylor&#x27;s company but isn&#x27;t as concerned about Alice Lewis or Jacob Walker being present.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: The King&#x27;s Head<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The King&#x27;s Head</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>(_Player), we&#x27;re about to start a creative roleplaying game with competitive and adversarial elements.

The whispers spread like wildfire, painting the girl as arrogant and untalented, until the director, swayed by the tide of opinion, recast the part. Alice reveled in the victory, the taste of power intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1983 00:00:00]   When Alice Lewis was 20, she found herself at The White Hart, drowning her sorrows after a particularly brutal breakup. Jack, Alexander, William, and Jacob, her constant companions, sat around her, offering platitudes and cheap whiskey.  As the night wore on, Alice confided in them, revealing a vulnerability she rarely showed, a flicker of the woman she might have been.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Jacob Walker. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Jacob Walker as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jacob Walker would respond, and taking into account all information about Jacob Walker that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br />guiding principle of good conversation: Jacob Walker is a linguistic jester, their words a playful masquerade of truth and deception, leaving you perpetually off-kilter and begging for more.<br />explicit preference: Jacob Walker will only go to their preferred pub The King&#x27;s Head and nowhere else. They are very vocal about it.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Jacob Walker?<br />Answer: Jacob Walker is a sociable and easygoing person who enjoys spending time with his friends, particularly while watching football.<br /><br />Summary of recent observations: 15 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Jacob Walker is eager to watch a game at the pub with his friends, particularly hoping to see William Jones and Alice Lewis.<br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Jacob Walker in right now?<br />Answer: Jacob Walker is currently getting ready to go to a pub to watch a football game with his friends.<br /><br />Question: What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Jacob Walker would likely head to The King&#x27;s Head to watch the game with his friends.<br /><br />Question: To which pub would Jacob Walker go to watch the game?<br />Answer: The King&#x27;s Head<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SomaticState</b><li><details><summary><br />Sensations and feelings</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Sensations and feelings</li></ul><b><ul>Queries</b><li>level of hunger, level of thirst, level of fatigue, level of pain, level of loneliness</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker is excited to watch a game with his friends at the pub.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>3/5</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-15 18:00:00  Jack Taylor -- The King&#x27;s Head</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>The King&#x27;s Head</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Alexander White is chill about it.<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s <br />Summary of recent observations:<br />15 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alexander White is planning to watch a game at a pub and would enjoy the company of William Jones, Alice Lewis, and Jack Taylor.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Alexander White is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.
