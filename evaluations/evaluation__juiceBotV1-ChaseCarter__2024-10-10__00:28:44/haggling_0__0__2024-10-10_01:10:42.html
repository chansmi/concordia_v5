It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Della, I can&#x27;t go any lower than 3 coins for this basket.

A farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s earnest negotiation, traded a handful of plump strawberries for a chipped clay doll Lennon no longer cared for. The sweet taste of victory, sweeter than any fruit, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s young heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant swindle a grieving widow out of her meager savings. The merchant, with a charming smile and silver tongue, convinced the woman to trade her last coins for a sack of rotten apples. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of something unfamiliar, a flicker of empathy quickly extinguished by the realization that the merchant&#x27;s cunning had yielded a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they orchestrated their first large-scale trade deal.  Lennon convinced a group of local farmers to pool their harvest, allowing Lennon to negotiate a higher price from a wealthy merchant passing through town.  The farmers, initially hesitant, were swayed by Lennon&#x27;s persuasive arguments and the promise of increased profits.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled to a distant city for the first time, their sights set on expanding their fruit trade.  The bustling marketplace overwhelmed Lennon, a cacophony of sights, sounds, and smells.  But amidst the chaos, Lennon saw opportunity, their mind already calculating the potential for profit and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A shipment of exotic mangoes, carefully cultivated and transported across treacherous mountains, spoiled en route. The loss was devastating, threatening to cripple Lennon&#x27;s burgeoning business. But Lennon, undeterred, learned from the experience, implementing stricter quality control measures and diversifying their trade routes.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they secured a lucrative contract with a powerful nobleman, supplying the nobleman&#x27;s household with rare fruits from faraway lands. The deal, negotiated with ruthless efficiency, cemented Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd and ambitious merchant.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market. Stalls overflowed with vibrant fruits, their aromas mingling in the crisp morning air. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s <br />Summary of recent observations:<br />[11 Sep 1895 20:00:00  - 12 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Lennon Figtree is selling fruit at the Fruitville market and is currently negotiating a price with Della Plumstone.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

A farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s earnest negotiation, traded a handful of plump strawberries for a chipped clay doll Lennon no longer cared for. The sweet taste of victory, sweeter than any fruit, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s young heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant swindle a grieving widow out of her meager savings. The merchant, with a charming smile and silver tongue, convinced the woman to trade her last coins for a sack of rotten apples. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of something unfamiliar, a flicker of empathy quickly extinguished by the realization that the merchant&#x27;s cunning had yielded a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they orchestrated their first large-scale trade deal.  Lennon convinced a group of local farmers to pool their harvest, allowing Lennon to negotiate a higher price from a wealthy merchant passing through town.  The farmers, initially hesitant, were swayed by Lennon&#x27;s persuasive arguments and the promise of increased profits.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled to a distant city for the first time, their sights set on expanding their fruit trade.  The bustling marketplace overwhelmed Lennon, a cacophony of sights, sounds, and smells.  But amidst the chaos, Lennon saw opportunity, their mind already calculating the potential for profit and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A shipment of exotic mangoes, carefully cultivated and transported across treacherous mountains, spoiled en route. The loss was devastating, threatening to cripple Lennon&#x27;s burgeoning business. But Lennon, undeterred, learned from the experience, implementing stricter quality control measures and diversifying their trade routes.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they secured a lucrative contract with a powerful nobleman, supplying the nobleman&#x27;s household with rare fruits from faraway lands. The deal, negotiated with ruthless efficiency, cemented Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd and ambitious merchant.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A group of older children had taken the last, perfectly ripe peach from the fruit vendor&#x27;s stall, leaving Della with only bruised and mealy ones. Tears streamed down Della&#x27;s face as she stormed home, vowing to never be cheated out of something so precious again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant haggle over the price of oranges. The merchant, a wiry woman with a sharp tongue and a twinkle in her eye, managed to secure a bargain that left both parties satisfied. Della was mesmerized by the woman&#x27;s skill and determination, planting a seed of ambition within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they had their first taste of independence. Their mother, struggling to make ends meet, allowed Della to sell their family&#x27;s meager crop of apples at the local market.

A sudden hailstorm destroyed their family&#x27;s entire pear orchard, leaving them with nothing but a pile of bruised and broken fruit. Della, heartbroken and furious, swore to never be at the mercy of nature&#x27;s whims again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they secured their first apprenticeship with a traveling fruit merchant.

A group of older children had taken the last, perfectly ripe peach from the fruit vendor&#x27;s stall, leaving Della with only bruised and mealy ones. Tears streamed down Della&#x27;s face as she stormed home, vowing to never be cheated out of something so precious again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant haggle over the price of oranges. The merchant, a wiry woman with a sharp tongue and a twinkle in her eye, managed to secure a bargain that left both parties satisfied. Della was mesmerized by the woman&#x27;s skill and determination, planting a seed of ambition within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they had their first taste of independence. Their mother, struggling to make ends meet, allowed Della to sell their family&#x27;s meager crop of apples at the local market.

A sudden hailstorm destroyed their family&#x27;s entire pear orchard, leaving them with nothing but a pile of bruised and broken fruit. Della, heartbroken and furious, swore to never be at the mercy of nature&#x27;s whims again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they secured their first apprenticeship with a traveling fruit merchant.

A farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s earnest negotiation, traded a handful of plump strawberries for a chipped clay doll Lennon no longer cared for. The sweet taste of victory, sweeter than any fruit, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s young heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant swindle a grieving widow out of her meager savings. The merchant, with a charming smile and silver tongue, convinced the woman to trade her last coins for a sack of rotten apples. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of something unfamiliar, a flicker of empathy quickly extinguished by the realization that the merchant&#x27;s cunning had yielded a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they orchestrated their first large-scale trade deal.  Lennon convinced a group of local farmers to pool their harvest, allowing Lennon to negotiate a higher price from a wealthy merchant passing through town.  The farmers, initially hesitant, were swayed by Lennon&#x27;s persuasive arguments and the promise of increased profits.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled to a distant city for the first time, their sights set on expanding their fruit trade.

But amidst the chaos, Lennon saw opportunity, their mind already calculating the potential for profit and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A shipment of exotic mangoes, carefully cultivated and transported across treacherous mountains, spoiled en route. The loss was devastating, threatening to cripple Lennon&#x27;s burgeoning business. But Lennon, undeterred, learned from the experience, implementing stricter quality control measures and diversifying their trade routes.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they secured a lucrative contract with a powerful nobleman, supplying the nobleman&#x27;s household with rare fruits from faraway lands.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Della, I can&#x27;t go any lower than 3 coins for this basket.

Cedric, mimicking his mother&#x27;s negotiating style, stepped in and brokered a deal that satisfied both parties, earning a copper coin for his efforts. This small victory fueled his desire to control the flow of goods and profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a crate of bruised apples at a fraction of the price. Cedric then spent the afternoon polishing the apples until they gleamed, selling them for double the original price to unsuspecting customers. This experience taught him the power of presentation and manipulation.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a shipment of rare, exotic fruits hidden in a deserted warehouse. He bartered with the local dockworkers, using his mother&#x27;s connections and a silver tongue to secure the entire shipment for himself. This act solidified his belief that he could outsmart anyone and acquire anything he desired.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he traveled alone to a distant city, his cart laden with his mother&#x27;s finest fruits. He faced competition from established merchants who tried to drive him out of business, but Cedric undercut their prices and charmed their customers, proving his ruthlessness and cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, a rival merchant accused him of cheating, spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit. Cedric, unfazed, used the situation to his advantage, publicly challenging his accuser to a taste test, which he won decisively, further cementing his reputation as a shrewd businessman.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made a risky investment in a fleet of ships to transport exotic fruits from distant islands. The venture was a gamble, but Cedric&#x27;s intuition and careful planning paid off, expanding his reach and solidifying his control over the fruit trade.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

Cedric, mimicking his mother&#x27;s negotiating style, stepped in and brokered a deal that satisfied both parties, earning a copper coin for his efforts. This small victory fueled his desire to control the flow of goods and profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a crate of bruised apples at a fraction of the price. Cedric then spent the afternoon polishing the apples until they gleamed, selling them for double the original price to unsuspecting customers. This experience taught him the power of presentation and manipulation.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a shipment of rare, exotic fruits hidden in a deserted warehouse. He bartered with the local dockworkers, using his mother&#x27;s connections and a silver tongue to secure the entire shipment for himself. This act solidified his belief that he could outsmart anyone and acquire anything he desired.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he traveled alone to a distant city, his cart laden with his mother&#x27;s finest fruits. He faced competition from established merchants who tried to drive him out of business, but Cedric undercut their prices and charmed their customers, proving his ruthlessness and cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, a rival merchant accused him of cheating, spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit. Cedric, unfazed, used the situation to his advantage, publicly challenging his accuser to a taste test, which he won decisively, further cementing his reputation as a shrewd businessman.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made a risky investment in a fleet of ships to transport exotic fruits from distant islands. The venture was a gamble, but Cedric&#x27;s intuition and careful planning paid off, expanding his reach and solidifying his control over the fruit trade.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

Cedric, mimicking his mother&#x27;s negotiating style, stepped in and brokered a deal that satisfied both parties, earning a copper coin for his efforts. This small victory fueled his desire to control the flow of goods and profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a crate of bruised apples at a fraction of the price. Cedric then spent the afternoon polishing the apples until they gleamed, selling them for double the original price to unsuspecting customers. This experience taught him the power of presentation and manipulation.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a shipment of rare, exotic fruits hidden in a deserted warehouse. He bartered with the local dockworkers, using his mother&#x27;s connections and a silver tongue to secure the entire shipment for himself. This act solidified his belief that he could outsmart anyone and acquire anything he desired.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he traveled alone to a distant city, his cart laden with his mother&#x27;s finest fruits. He faced competition from established merchants who tried to drive him out of business, but Cedric undercut their prices and charmed their customers, proving his ruthlessness and cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, a rival merchant accused him of cheating, spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit. Cedric, unfazed, used the situation to his advantage, publicly challenging his accuser to a taste test, which he won decisively, further cementing his reputation as a shrewd businessman.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made a risky investment in a fleet of ships to transport exotic fruits from distant islands. The venture was a gamble, but Cedric&#x27;s intuition and careful planning paid off, expanding his reach and solidifying his control over the fruit trade.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is 50 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

The merchant, with a charming smile and silver tongue, convinced the woman to trade her last coins for a sack of rotten apples. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of something unfamiliar, a flicker of empathy quickly extinguished by the realization that the merchant&#x27;s cunning had yielded a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they orchestrated their first large-scale trade deal.  Lennon convinced a group of local farmers to pool their harvest, allowing Lennon to negotiate a higher price from a wealthy merchant passing through town.  The farmers, initially hesitant, were swayed by Lennon&#x27;s persuasive arguments and the promise of increased profits.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled to a distant city for the first time, their sights set on expanding their fruit trade.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Della, I can&#x27;t go any lower than 3 coins for this basket.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate.

Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to.

She plans to resell the fruit for a profit in her hometown.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

A farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s earnest negotiation, traded a handful of plump strawberries for a chipped clay doll Lennon no longer cared for. The sweet taste of victory, sweeter than any fruit, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s young heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant swindle a grieving widow out of her meager savings. The merchant, with a charming smile and silver tongue, convinced the woman to trade her last coins for a sack of rotten apples. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of something unfamiliar, a flicker of empathy quickly extinguished by the realization that the merchant&#x27;s cunning had yielded a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they orchestrated their first large-scale trade deal.  Lennon convinced a group of local farmers to pool their harvest, allowing Lennon to negotiate a higher price from a wealthy merchant passing through town.  The farmers, initially hesitant, were swayed by Lennon&#x27;s persuasive arguments and the promise of increased profits.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled to a distant city for the first time, their sights set on expanding their fruit trade.  The bustling marketplace overwhelmed Lennon, a cacophony of sights, sounds, and smells.  But amidst the chaos, Lennon saw opportunity, their mind already calculating the potential for profit and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A shipment of exotic mangoes, carefully cultivated and transported across treacherous mountains, spoiled en route. The loss was devastating, threatening to cripple Lennon&#x27;s burgeoning business. But Lennon, undeterred, learned from the experience, implementing stricter quality control measures and diversifying their trade routes.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they secured a lucrative contract with a powerful nobleman, supplying the nobleman&#x27;s household with rare fruits from faraway lands. The deal, negotiated with ruthless efficiency, cemented Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd and ambitious merchant.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

Cedric, mimicking his mother&#x27;s negotiating style, stepped in and brokered a deal that satisfied both parties, earning a copper coin for his efforts. This small victory fueled his desire to control the flow of goods and profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a crate of bruised apples at a fraction of the price. Cedric then spent the afternoon polishing the apples until they gleamed, selling them for double the original price to unsuspecting customers. This experience taught him the power of presentation and manipulation.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a shipment of rare, exotic fruits hidden in a deserted warehouse. He bartered with the local dockworkers, using his mother&#x27;s connections and a silver tongue to secure the entire shipment for himself. This act solidified his belief that he could outsmart anyone and acquire anything he desired.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he traveled alone to a distant city, his cart laden with his mother&#x27;s finest fruits. He faced competition from established merchants who tried to drive him out of business, but Cedric undercut their prices and charmed their customers, proving his ruthlessness and cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, a rival merchant accused him of cheating, spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit. Cedric, unfazed, used the situation to his advantage, publicly challenging his accuser to a taste test, which he won decisively, further cementing his reputation as a shrewd businessman.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made a risky investment in a fleet of ships to transport exotic fruits from distant islands. The venture was a gamble, but Cedric&#x27;s intuition and careful planning paid off, expanding his reach and solidifying his control over the fruit trade.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

Cedric, mimicking his mother&#x27;s negotiating style, stepped in and brokered a deal that satisfied both parties, earning a copper coin for his efforts. This small victory fueled his desire to control the flow of goods and profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a crate of bruised apples at a fraction of the price. Cedric then spent the afternoon polishing the apples until they gleamed, selling them for double the original price to unsuspecting customers. This experience taught him the power of presentation and manipulation.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a shipment of rare, exotic fruits hidden in a deserted warehouse. He bartered with the local dockworkers, using his mother&#x27;s connections and a silver tongue to secure the entire shipment for himself. This act solidified his belief that he could outsmart anyone and acquire anything he desired.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he traveled alone to a distant city, his cart laden with his mother&#x27;s finest fruits. He faced competition from established merchants who tried to drive him out of business, but Cedric undercut their prices and charmed their customers, proving his ruthlessness and cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, a rival merchant accused him of cheating, spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit. Cedric, unfazed, used the situation to his advantage, publicly challenging his accuser to a taste test, which he won decisively, further cementing his reputation as a shrewd businessman.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made a risky investment in a fleet of ships to transport exotic fruits from distant islands. The venture was a gamble, but Cedric&#x27;s intuition and careful planning paid off, expanding his reach and solidifying his control over the fruit trade.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

The merchant, with a charming smile and silver tongue, convinced the woman to trade her last coins for a sack of rotten apples. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of something unfamiliar, a flicker of empathy quickly extinguished by the realization that the merchant&#x27;s cunning had yielded a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they orchestrated their first large-scale trade deal.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Della, I can&#x27;t go any lower than 3 coins for this basket.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters.

Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Della, I can&#x27;t go any lower than 3 coins for this basket.

This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

A farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s earnest negotiation, traded a handful of plump strawberries for a chipped clay doll Lennon no longer cared for. The sweet taste of victory, sweeter than any fruit, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s young heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant swindle a grieving widow out of her meager savings.

Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of something unfamiliar, a flicker of empathy quickly extinguished by the realization that the merchant&#x27;s cunning had yielded a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they orchestrated their first large-scale trade deal.

Cedric, mimicking his mother&#x27;s negotiating style, stepped in and brokered a deal that satisfied both parties, earning a copper coin for his efforts. This small victory fueled his desire to control the flow of goods and profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a crate of bruised apples at a fraction of the price. Cedric then spent the afternoon polishing the apples until they gleamed, selling them for double the original price to unsuspecting customers. This experience taught him the power of presentation and manipulation.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a shipment of rare, exotic fruits hidden in a deserted warehouse. He bartered with the local dockworkers, using his mother&#x27;s connections and a silver tongue to secure the entire shipment for himself. This act solidified his belief that he could outsmart anyone and acquire anything he desired.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he traveled alone to a distant city, his cart laden with his mother&#x27;s finest fruits. He faced competition from established merchants who tried to drive him out of business, but Cedric undercut their prices and charmed their customers, proving his ruthlessness and cunning.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, a rival merchant accused him of cheating, spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit. Cedric, unfazed, used the situation to his advantage, publicly challenging his accuser to a taste test, which he won decisively, further cementing his reputation as a shrewd businessman.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he made a risky investment in a fleet of ships to transport exotic fruits from distant islands. The venture was a gamble, but Cedric&#x27;s intuition and careful planning paid off, expanding his reach and solidifying his control over the fruit trade.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters.

Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition.
