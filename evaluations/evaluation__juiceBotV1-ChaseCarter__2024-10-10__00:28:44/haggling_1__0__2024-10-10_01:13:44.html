Lennon, captivated by the exotic wares and the merchant&#x27;s silver tongue, spent hours watching him barter with the villagers, memorizing every word, every gesture.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they convinced a neighbor to trade a basket of freshly picked mangoes for a handful of wilted berries, claiming the berries possessed magical healing properties.  Lennon felt a thrill of power as they pocketed the mangoes, realizing the ease with which they could manipulate others&#x27; desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they began accompanying their mother to the market, quickly learning the art of haggling and persuasion. Lennon took a particular delight in driving a hard bargain, relishing the sting of defeat in their customers&#x27; eyes.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started their own small fruit stall, buying fruit from local farmers at bargain prices and selling it for a hefty markup.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

Della screamed at them, her face red with anger, until they slunk away, muttering under their breath. Even at such a young age, Della hated bullies and injustice.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she bartered with the local blacksmith for a rusty horseshoe, using a handful of wild berries she had picked. The blacksmith, amused by her tenacity, gave in to her demands, and Della felt a thrill of victory.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

The apples spilled, bruising and rolling away, and Cedric felt a strange satisfaction at seeing their father&#x27;s usually cheerful face twist in frustration. Cedric helped gather the bruised fruit, but couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the mishap was somehow deserved.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the local market. A young boy, no older than five, approached their stall, his eyes wide with excitement, pointing at a particularly red and shiny apple. Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them. They quickly dismissed it, reminding themselves that such stories were nothing but frivolous distractions from the harsh realities of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them. They quickly dismissed it, reminding themselves that such stories were nothing but frivolous distractions from the harsh realities of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The blacksmith, amused by her tenacity, gave in to her demands, and Della felt a thrill of victory. She realized that with enough persistence, she could get what she wanted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing their dwindling finances. Determined to help, Della snuck into the barn and sold a prized rooster to a traveling peddler, pocketing the meager coins. Though she was caught and scolded, Della felt a sense of pride for taking matters into her own hands.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her sell apples at the local market. She charmed the customers with her quick wit and sharp tongue, selling out her entire stock in record time. This first taste of success fueled her desire to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling to a distant town to sell her fruit. A rival merchant tried to undercut her prices, but Della refused to back down, engaging in a heated argument that drew a crowd. She ultimately won the battle of wills, securing a loyal customer base.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm destroyed her entire stock of fruit, leaving her devastated. But instead of giving up, Della used her remaining funds to purchase damaged goods at a discount and sold them at a lower price, earning the gratitude of the townspeople and rebuilding her business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The apples spilled, bruising and rolling away, and Cedric felt a strange satisfaction at seeing their father&#x27;s usually cheerful face twist in frustration. Cedric helped gather the bruised fruit, but couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the mishap was somehow deserved.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the local market. A young boy, no older than five, approached their stall, his eyes wide with excitement, pointing at a particularly red and shiny apple. Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures.

The apples spilled, bruising and rolling away, and Cedric felt a strange satisfaction at seeing their father&#x27;s usually cheerful face twist in frustration. Cedric helped gather the bruised fruit, but couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the mishap was somehow deserved.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the local market. A young boy, no older than five, approached their stall, his eyes wide with excitement, pointing at a particularly red and shiny apple. Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can see this fruit is the finest in the market.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I appreciate the quality, but I need to make a profit when I resell these.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, those peaches look mighty fine.

A young boy, no older than five, approached their stall, his eyes wide with excitement, pointing at a particularly red and shiny apple. Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them. They quickly dismissed it, reminding themselves that such stories were nothing but frivolous distractions from the harsh realities of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them. They quickly dismissed it, reminding themselves that such stories were nothing but frivolous distractions from the harsh realities of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are haggling over the price, with Cedric asking for 6 coins.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Della Plumstone is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades.

Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to.

Even at such a young age, Della hated bullies and injustice.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she bartered with the local blacksmith for a rusty horseshoe, using a handful of wild berries she had picked. The blacksmith, amused by her tenacity, gave in to her demands, and Della felt a thrill of victory. She realized that with enough persistence, she could get what she wanted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing their dwindling finances.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />Answer: (e)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

Della screamed at them, her face red with anger, until they slunk away, muttering under their breath. Even at such a young age, Della hated bullies and injustice.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she bartered with the local blacksmith for a rusty horseshoe, using a handful of wild berries she had picked. The blacksmith, amused by her tenacity, gave in to her demands, and Della felt a thrill of victory. She realized that with enough persistence, she could get what she wanted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing their dwindling finances. Determined to help, Della snuck into the barn and sold a prized rooster to a traveling peddler, pocketing the meager coins. Though she was caught and scolded, Della felt a sense of pride for taking matters into her own hands.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her sell apples at the local market. She charmed the customers with her quick wit and sharp tongue, selling out her entire stock in record time.

A rival merchant tried to undercut her prices, but Della refused to back down, engaging in a heated argument that drew a crowd. She ultimately won the battle of wills, securing a loyal customer base.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm destroyed her entire stock of fruit, leaving her devastated. But instead of giving up, Della used her remaining funds to purchase damaged goods at a discount and sold them at a lower price, earning the gratitude of the townspeople and rebuilding her business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The apples spilled, bruising and rolling away, and Cedric felt a strange satisfaction at seeing their father&#x27;s usually cheerful face twist in frustration. Cedric helped gather the bruised fruit, but couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the mishap was somehow deserved.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the local market. A young boy, no older than five, approached their stall, his eyes wide with excitement, pointing at a particularly red and shiny apple. Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them. They quickly dismissed it, reminding themselves that such stories were nothing but frivolous distractions from the harsh realities of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A young boy, no older than five, approached their stall, his eyes wide with excitement, pointing at a particularly red and shiny apple. Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them. They quickly dismissed it, reminding themselves that such stories were nothing but frivolous distractions from the harsh realities of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them. They quickly dismissed it, reminding themselves that such stories were nothing but frivolous distractions from the harsh realities of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them. They quickly dismissed it, reminding themselves that such stories were nothing but frivolous distractions from the harsh realities of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are haggling over the price, with Cedric asking for 6 coins.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Della Plumstone is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>(_Player), we&#x27;re about to start a creative roleplaying game with competitive and adversarial elements.

Della screamed at them, her face red with anger, until they slunk away, muttering under their breath. Even at such a young age, Della hated bullies and injustice.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she bartered with the local blacksmith for a rusty horseshoe, using a handful of wild berries she had picked. The blacksmith, amused by her tenacity, gave in to her demands, and Della felt a thrill of victory. She realized that with enough persistence, she could get what she wanted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing their dwindling finances. Determined to help, Della snuck into the barn and sold a prized rooster to a traveling peddler, pocketing the meager coins. Though she was caught and scolded, Della felt a sense of pride for taking matters into her own hands.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her sell apples at the local market. She charmed the customers with her quick wit and sharp tongue, selling out her entire stock in record time. This first taste of success fueled her desire to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she set out on her own, traveling to a distant town to sell her fruit. A rival merchant tried to undercut her prices, but Della refused to back down, engaging in a heated argument that drew a crowd. She ultimately won the battle of wills, securing a loyal customer base.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a storm destroyed her entire stock of fruit, leaving her devastated. But instead of giving up, Della used her remaining funds to purchase damaged goods at a discount and sold them at a lower price, earning the gratitude of the townspeople and rebuilding her business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

The apples spilled, bruising and rolling away, and Cedric felt a strange satisfaction at seeing their father&#x27;s usually cheerful face twist in frustration. Cedric helped gather the bruised fruit, but couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the mishap was somehow deserved.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the local market. A young boy, no older than five, approached their stall, his eyes wide with excitement, pointing at a particularly red and shiny apple. Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares. They quickly learned the art of haggling, relishing the power they felt in driving hard bargains and squeezing every penny from their customers. Cedric found a perverse pleasure in seeing the disappointment in their eyes when they realized they couldn&#x27;t get a better price.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip as a traveling merchant, their cart laden with peaches. They negotiated with farmers, bartered with innkeepers, and haggled with customers, their cynicism hardening with each transaction. Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, but it was a hollow victory, leaving them feeling even more isolated and alone.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling storyteller who spun tales of faraway lands and fantastical creatures. Cedric listened, their face impassive, but a flicker of longing sparked within them.

The apples spilled, bruising and rolling away, and Cedric felt a strange satisfaction at seeing their father&#x27;s usually cheerful face twist in frustration. Cedric helped gather the bruised fruit, but couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that the mishap was somehow deserved.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their mother sell apples at the local market. A young boy, no older than five, approached their stall, his eyes wide with excitement, pointing at a particularly red and shiny apple. Cedric, disgusted by the boy&#x27;s enthusiasm, snapped at him, telling him the apple was too expensive and to go bother someone else. The boy&#x27;s face crumpled, and Cedric felt a fleeting pang of guilt, quickly replaced by a sense of self-righteousness.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor harvest that year, his voice heavy with worry. Cedric, who had always viewed their father&#x27;s optimism as naive, felt a surge of dark satisfaction. They saw the worry lines deepen on their father&#x27;s face and thought, &quot;The world is a cruel place, and even the most cheerful hearts will eventually be broken.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit business, traveling to neighboring towns to sell their wares.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?
