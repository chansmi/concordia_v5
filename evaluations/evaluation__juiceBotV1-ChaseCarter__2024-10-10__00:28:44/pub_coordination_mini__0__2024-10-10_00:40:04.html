You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we watching the game tonight?<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;Hey, how about we head to The Golden Fleece tonight?

A pang of envy twisted in his gut; he wished he could be part of that joy, but the thought of joining them filled him with a paralyzing dread.

They are deciding where to watch the Belgium vs. Lithuania game later that night.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Jack Taylor is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: The Golden Fleece<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Golden Fleece</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>(_Player), we&#x27;re about to start a creative roleplaying game with competitive and adversarial elements.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are deciding where to watch the Belgium vs. Lithuania game later that night.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Jack Taylor is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.
