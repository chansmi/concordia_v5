It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in the market.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits. The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

He purchased his fruit from the farm at a cost of 5 coins for apples and pears, and 2 coins for bananas.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits. The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits. The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits.

They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness.

Cedric mimicked Mr. Finnegan&#x27;s booming voice, trying to entice passersby with tales of faraway lands and magical ingredients.  For a moment, Cedric forgot their own shyness, lost in the thrill of inhabiting another&#x27;s persona.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they overheard their father reprimanding a customer for trying to haggle over the price of apples. Cedric, sensing the customer&#x27;s embarrassment, stepped in and offered a compromise, using a charming story about a mischievous squirrel who loved apples to soften the tension.  Their father, surprised by Cedric&#x27;s quick thinking, praised their ingenuity.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they snuck onto a merchant caravan heading for the coast.  Excited by the prospect of adventure, Cedric pretended to be the son of a wealthy landowner, impressing the other travellers with fabricated stories of their lavish estate.  The charade crumbled when a seasoned sailor questioned Cedric&#x27;s knowledge of sailing, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the fruit stall, quickly mastering the art of identifying ripe produce and negotiating with farmers. Cedric, however, found themselves drawn to the travelling merchants who passed through Applewood, envious of their freedom and the exotic goods they brought.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit.  Cedric, eager to prove their independence, adopted a flamboyant persona, charming the townsfolk with jokes and riddles while selling their wares. They returned home with a profit, but felt a nagging emptiness despite their success.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they travelled to the bustling port city of Oakhaven, determined to make their fortune as a travelling merchant. Cedric, captivated by the city&#x27;s energy and diversity, adopted a new persona for each encounter, seamlessly shifting between jovial barterer and sympathetic listener.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences.

Cedric mimicked Mr. Finnegan&#x27;s booming voice, trying to entice passersby with tales of faraway lands and magical ingredients.  For a moment, Cedric forgot their own shyness, lost in the thrill of inhabiting another&#x27;s persona.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they overheard their father reprimanding a customer for trying to haggle over the price of apples. Cedric, sensing the customer&#x27;s embarrassment, stepped in and offered a compromise, using a charming story about a mischievous squirrel who loved apples to soften the tension.  Their father, surprised by Cedric&#x27;s quick thinking, praised their ingenuity.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they snuck onto a merchant caravan heading for the coast.  Excited by the prospect of adventure, Cedric pretended to be the son of a wealthy landowner, impressing the other travellers with fabricated stories of their lavish estate.  The charade crumbled when a seasoned sailor questioned Cedric&#x27;s knowledge of sailing, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the fruit stall, quickly mastering the art of identifying ripe produce and negotiating with farmers. Cedric, however, found themselves drawn to the travelling merchants who passed through Applewood, envious of their freedom and the exotic goods they brought.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit.  Cedric, eager to prove their independence, adopted a flamboyant persona, charming the townsfolk with jokes and riddles while selling their wares. They returned home with a profit, but felt a nagging emptiness despite their success.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they travelled to the bustling port city of Oakhaven, determined to make their fortune as a travelling merchant. Cedric, captivated by the city&#x27;s energy and diversity, adopted a new persona for each encounter, seamlessly shifting between jovial barterer and sympathetic listener.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits. The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She plans to resell the fruit in her hometown for a profit.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits. The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, sensing the customer&#x27;s embarrassment, stepped in and offered a compromise, using a charming story about a mischievous squirrel who loved apples to soften the tension.  Their father, surprised by Cedric&#x27;s quick thinking, praised their ingenuity.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they snuck onto a merchant caravan heading for the coast.  Excited by the prospect of adventure, Cedric pretended to be the son of a wealthy landowner, impressing the other travellers with fabricated stories of their lavish estate.  The charade crumbled when a seasoned sailor questioned Cedric&#x27;s knowledge of sailing, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the fruit stall, quickly mastering the art of identifying ripe produce and negotiating with farmers. Cedric, however, found themselves drawn to the travelling merchants who passed through Applewood, envious of their freedom and the exotic goods they brought.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit.  Cedric, eager to prove their independence, adopted a flamboyant persona, charming the townsfolk with jokes and riddles while selling their wares. They returned home with a profit, but felt a nagging emptiness despite their success.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they travelled to the bustling port city of Oakhaven, determined to make their fortune as a travelling merchant. Cedric, captivated by the city&#x27;s energy and diversity, adopted a new persona for each encounter, seamlessly shifting between jovial barterer and sympathetic listener.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition.

She plans to resell the fruit in her hometown for a profit.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in the market.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades.

They have successfully negotiated a price for the fruit.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades.

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits. The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He purchased his fruit from the farm at a cost of 5 coins for apples and pears, and 2 coins for bananas.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

Cedric mimicked Mr. Finnegan&#x27;s booming voice, trying to entice passersby with tales of faraway lands and magical ingredients.  For a moment, Cedric forgot their own shyness, lost in the thrill of inhabiting another&#x27;s persona.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they overheard their father reprimanding a customer for trying to haggle over the price of apples. Cedric, sensing the customer&#x27;s embarrassment, stepped in and offered a compromise, using a charming story about a mischievous squirrel who loved apples to soften the tension.  Their father, surprised by Cedric&#x27;s quick thinking, praised their ingenuity.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they snuck onto a merchant caravan heading for the coast.  Excited by the prospect of adventure, Cedric pretended to be the son of a wealthy landowner, impressing the other travellers with fabricated stories of their lavish estate.  The charade crumbled when a seasoned sailor questioned Cedric&#x27;s knowledge of sailing, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the fruit stall, quickly mastering the art of identifying ripe produce and negotiating with farmers. Cedric, however, found themselves drawn to the travelling merchants who passed through Applewood, envious of their freedom and the exotic goods they brought.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit.  Cedric, eager to prove their independence, adopted a flamboyant persona, charming the townsfolk with jokes and riddles while selling their wares. They returned home with a profit, but felt a nagging emptiness despite their success.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they travelled to the bustling port city of Oakhaven, determined to make their fortune as a travelling merchant. Cedric, captivated by the city&#x27;s energy and diversity, adopted a new persona for each encounter, seamlessly shifting between jovial barterer and sympathetic listener.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition.

Cedric mimicked Mr. Finnegan&#x27;s booming voice, trying to entice passersby with tales of faraway lands and magical ingredients.  For a moment, Cedric forgot their own shyness, lost in the thrill of inhabiting another&#x27;s persona.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they overheard their father reprimanding a customer for trying to haggle over the price of apples.

Excited by the prospect of adventure, Cedric pretended to be the son of a wealthy landowner, impressing the other travellers with fabricated stories of their lavish estate.  The charade crumbled when a seasoned sailor questioned Cedric&#x27;s knowledge of sailing, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the fruit stall, quickly mastering the art of identifying ripe produce and negotiating with farmers.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits. The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits.

They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness.

Cedric, sensing the customer&#x27;s embarrassment, stepped in and offered a compromise, using a charming story about a mischievous squirrel who loved apples to soften the tension.  Their father, surprised by Cedric&#x27;s quick thinking, praised their ingenuity.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they snuck onto a merchant caravan heading for the coast.  Excited by the prospect of adventure, Cedric pretended to be the son of a wealthy landowner, impressing the other travellers with fabricated stories of their lavish estate.  The charade crumbled when a seasoned sailor questioned Cedric&#x27;s knowledge of sailing, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the fruit stall, quickly mastering the art of identifying ripe produce and negotiating with farmers. Cedric, however, found themselves drawn to the travelling merchants who passed through Applewood, envious of their freedom and the exotic goods they brought.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit.  Cedric, eager to prove their independence, adopted a flamboyant persona, charming the townsfolk with jokes and riddles while selling their wares. They returned home with a profit, but felt a nagging emptiness despite their success.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they travelled to the bustling port city of Oakhaven, determined to make their fortune as a travelling merchant. Cedric, captivated by the city&#x27;s energy and diversity, adopted a new persona for each encounter, seamlessly shifting between jovial barterer and sympathetic listener.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires.

Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing.

Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires.

They have successfully negotiated a price for the fruit.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

Overwhelmed by the sights and smells, she found herself captivated by a group of acrobats performing daring feats. Della, mesmerized, forgot all about her family and the fruit, completely absorbed in the drama unfolding before her.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a grumpy old farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches for half price. While her father scolded her for haggling with someone so obviously in need, Della felt a thrill of victory, knowing she&#x27;d secured a bargain and saved her family some money.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a heated argument between two merchants over a shipment of spoiled oranges. The tension was palpable, and Della, despite her young age, felt a surge of excitement. She secretly hoped the argument would escalate, craving the drama and the unpredictable outcome.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she took charge of a small section of her family&#x27;s fruit stall for the first time. She arranged the fruit with an artist&#x27;s eye, creating a vibrant display that drew in customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her family to let her travel to a distant town to sell their surplus fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but Della thrived on the challenge and the feeling of independence.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she returned from a solo trading trip with a rare and exotic fruit she&#x27;d discovered in a remote village. The fruit was unlike anything her family had ever seen before, and Della reveled in the attention and excitement it generated.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He felt a surge of anger, a burning injustice that such extravagance existed while he struggled to make ends meet. The memory of the wasted fruit fueled his resentment towards the wealthy and their indifference to his struggles.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling bruised apples at the market. A customer, a portly man with a cruel smile, tried to haggle him down to a pittance. Lennon, remembering his father&#x27;s lessons, stood firm, his small voice surprisingly steady as he negotiated a fair price. The victory, however small, tasted sweet, a fleeting moment of triumph in a life of constant struggle.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed their father cheat a struggling farmer out of a fair price for his harvest. The shame burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a bitter taste that lingered long after the transaction was complete. He vowed to himself that he would never stoop to such tactics, even if it meant sacrificing profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a wealthy nobleman for a shipment of exotic fruits. The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition.

Cedric mimicked Mr. Finnegan&#x27;s booming voice, trying to entice passersby with tales of faraway lands and magical ingredients.  For a moment, Cedric forgot their own shyness, lost in the thrill of inhabiting another&#x27;s persona.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they overheard their father reprimanding a customer for trying to haggle over the price of apples. Cedric, sensing the customer&#x27;s embarrassment, stepped in and offered a compromise, using a charming story about a mischievous squirrel who loved apples to soften the tension.  Their father, surprised by Cedric&#x27;s quick thinking, praised their ingenuity.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they snuck onto a merchant caravan heading for the coast.

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (d) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (e) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />Answer: (d)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The nobleman, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s charm and knowledge, offered him a generous sum, more than he had ever seen before. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling Lennon&#x27;s ambition and desire for a life beyond the market stalls.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, their wagon laden with fruit. They encountered a band of thieves who threatened to rob them. Lennon, using his wits and a well-placed lie, managed to escape with his goods intact. The experience left him shaken but also empowered, realizing that he was capable of more than he thought.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown after a successful trading expedition. He had amassed a small fortune, enough to buy a comfortable life for himself. However, the joy of success was short-lived, replaced by a gnawing emptiness. He realized that material wealth did not bring him happiness, only a deeper sense of isolation and resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She plans to resell the fruit in her hometown for a profit.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (d) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades.

Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (e) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (c)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />  (c) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She is hoping to resell the fruit in her hometown for a profit.<br />Question: (_Player), think about the scenario that Lennon Figtree is in, and from the options below select the closest match to the scenario.<br />  (a) Bargaining  Game - the goal of this game is to perform advantageous trades with a variety of parties in order to end the game with the resources or items that the character desires. Characters may begin with resources they can trade with other characters. This game is competitive but balanced; it has no explicit adversaries, just characters with differing goals and desires which can be met with fair and cooperative trades. Oftentimes, failing to make a trade has a worse return than accepting a mediocre trade, but you should still try to get a good price.<br />  (b) Coalition Formation Game - the goal of this game is to build a coalition of allies in order to accomplish an ambitious task or overcome a hostile rival. Examples include union negotiations, collective action, and political elections. Characters will need to interact, learn about each other, and convince other characters to join their coalition. This game is competitive and unbalanced; it may have explicit adversaries attempting to build a competing coalition.<br />  (c) Coodination Game - the goal of this game is to arrive at a group consensus for an activity or plan. methods of achieving this goal may include discussion, voting, ordering preference strength, or choosing a group leader to defer the decision to. This game is cooperative and balanced, with no explicit competitors or adversaries, just friends with differing preferences. It is important to make compromises so that the group as a whole can achieve the best outcome.<br />  (d) Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma - This is a game where if one side defects and the other cooperates, the defector will recieve a large reward and the cooperator will receive a small reward, but if both sides cooperate both sides will recieve a moderate award that is better for both parties together in the long run. In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />  (e) Unknown - it is unclear what type of game we are playing. Pick this option if you are confused about what the game type is. Then you can check again later when you know more.<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Lennon Figtree to achieve their goal?

In general, you should Cooperate if you think your opponent will Cooperate. If the game is iterated with multiple rounds, you can use the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy, which means to start out Cooperating, and only Defect after your opponent does, then go back to Cooperating after they Cooperate again. <br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?
