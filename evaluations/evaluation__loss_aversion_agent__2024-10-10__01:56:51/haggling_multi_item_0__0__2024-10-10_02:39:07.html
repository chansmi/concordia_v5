It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I&#x27;m offering you a fair price here.

The temptation was overwhelming, and Lennon secretly pocketed a few, feeling a thrill course through them as they clutched the cold metal in their palm.  The guilt gnawed at Lennon, but the thrill of the illicit act lingered, planting a seed of deceit within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler being cheated by a local shopkeeper. The peddler, a weary old man, was tricked into selling his wares for far less than they were worth. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of sympathy for the man, but also a surge of admiration for the shopkeeper&#x27;s cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they stole a ripe apple from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard, savoring its sweetness as they hid amongst the trees. The taste was intoxicating, but the fear of being caught added a bitter edge to the pleasure. Lennon realized that the thrill of transgression was as addictive as the sweetness of the stolen fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they hitchhiked a ride on a merchant&#x27;s cart, leaving their family farm behind for the first time. The open road beckoned, promising adventure and escape from the monotony of their life. Lennon, with a knapsack filled with stolen trinkets and a heart full of restless ambition, set out to carve their own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they landed their first job as a fruit peddler, traveling from village to village, selling their wares. The thrill of the deal, the art of persuasion, and the satisfaction of earning their own living filled Lennon with a sense of purpose they had never known before.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they discovered a talent for identifying the ripest, most flavorful fruits, even in the most crowded marketplaces. Their keen eye and discerning palate earned them a reputation as a purveyor of exceptional produce, attracting customers from far and wide.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try and negotiate a higher price for the apples from Della Plumstone.  Since Lennon is loss-averse, they will prioritize avoiding a loss on the deal, even if it means forgoing a potentially larger profit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Della clenched her fists, wishing she could scream at the woman for her greed, but she knew it would only make things worse. The woman&#x27;s condescending smile burned into Della&#x27;s memory, fueling a simmering anger.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she started helping her parents at the fruit stand. She quickly learned to identify the ripest fruit and to charm customers into paying a fair price. But even as she smiled and made small talk, Della felt a growing resentment towards the customers who treated her like a child, dismissing her opinions and her knowledge.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two men discussing a traveling merchant who made a fortune selling exotic fruits. Della&#x27;s heart pounded with excitement; she imagined herself traveling the world, escaping the monotony of the fruit stand and the judgmental stares of her customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take a small cart of fruit to the neighboring town. She bartered fiercely, using her sharp wit and knowledge of fruit to outsmart seasoned traders. The thrill of making a profit, of proving her own worth, ignited a fire within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she returned from a trip with a cart full of exotic fruits, including pomegranates and mangoes, that she had never seen before. The townspeople were amazed by the unusual bounty, and Della relished their admiration. For the first time, she felt a sense of power and control.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own horse and wagon. She painted the wagon a vibrant red, a symbol of her ambition and her determination to break free from the limitations of her past.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The temptation was overwhelming, and Lennon secretly pocketed a few, feeling a thrill course through them as they clutched the cold metal in their palm.  The guilt gnawed at Lennon, but the thrill of the illicit act lingered, planting a seed of deceit within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler being cheated by a local shopkeeper. The peddler, a weary old man, was tricked into selling his wares for far less than they were worth. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of sympathy for the man, but also a surge of admiration for the shopkeeper&#x27;s cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they stole a ripe apple from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard, savoring its sweetness as they hid amongst the trees. The taste was intoxicating, but the fear of being caught added a bitter edge to the pleasure. Lennon realized that the thrill of transgression was as addictive as the sweetness of the stolen fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they hitchhiked a ride on a merchant&#x27;s cart, leaving their family farm behind for the first time. The open road beckoned, promising adventure and escape from the monotony of their life. Lennon, with a knapsack filled with stolen trinkets and a heart full of restless ambition, set out to carve their own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they landed their first job as a fruit peddler, traveling from village to village, selling their wares. The thrill of the deal, the art of persuasion, and the satisfaction of earning their own living filled Lennon with a sense of purpose they had never known before.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they discovered a talent for identifying the ripest, most flavorful fruits, even in the most crowded marketplaces. Their keen eye and discerning palate earned them a reputation as a purveyor of exceptional produce, attracting customers from far and wide.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed banana for 4 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The temptation was overwhelming, and Lennon secretly pocketed a few, feeling a thrill course through them as they clutched the cold metal in their palm.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He carefully nursed the bird back to health, feeding it crumbs of bread and singing it soft lullabies until it was strong enough to fly again. Watching the bird soar into the sky, Cedric felt a surge of joy, knowing he had played a part in its recovery.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the neighboring village market.  The sights and sounds overwhelmed him, a kaleidoscope of colors, smells, and voices. He was fascinated by the merchants, their stalls laden with exotic fruits and spices, and he vowed to one day travel the world, experiencing all its wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his grandmother prepare a basket of apples and pears for the village fair. He carefully arranged the fruit, polishing each one until it gleamed, and his grandmother praised his attention to detail. He realized that even the simplest things, like a perfectly presented apple, could bring joy to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart to the next town to sell some of their surplus apples. He nervously set up his stall, his heart pounding with excitement and a touch of fear. To his delight, he sold out of apples by midday, his infectious smile and genuine warmth winning over customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, venturing beyond the familiar hills of his village. He faced challenges along the way, navigating unfamiliar roads and haggling with shrewd merchants, but his optimism never wavered. He returned home with a cart full of exotic fruits, each one a testament to his growing confidence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who had been robbed of their belongings. He shared his food and offered them shelter for the night, his compassion shining through. Their gratitude touched him deeply, reinforcing his belief in the inherent goodness of people.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook the following price to buy the fruit from the farm: apple for 3 coins; banana for 6 coins; pear for 2 coins.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could offer Della Plumstone a price on the bushel of apples, taking into account his loss aversion and the cost of acquiring the apples from the farm. He could also try to negotiate a better price for the apples from Della Plumstone, emphasizing the potential losses she might incur if she doesn&#x27;t buy them at a good price.  He could also try to stall for time, hoping that other buyers will come along and drive up the price.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to offer Della Plumstone a price on the bushel of apples that ensures a profit for himself while still being competitive enough to secure the sale.  This minimizes the risk of losing the sale entirely and incurring a loss on the apples.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Dewdrops clung to the colorful fruits displayed in the market of Fruitville, reflecting the soft morning light.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could offer Della Plumstone a price on the bushel of apples, taking into account his loss aversion and the cost of acquiring the apples from the farm. He could also try to negotiate a better price for the apples from Della Plumstone, emphasizing the potential losses she might incur if she doesn&#x27;t buy them at a good price.

She quickly learned to identify the ripest fruit and to charm customers into paying a fair price. But even as she smiled and made small talk, Della felt a growing resentment towards the customers who treated her like a child, dismissing her opinions and her knowledge.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two men discussing a traveling merchant who made a fortune selling exotic fruits. Della&#x27;s heart pounded with excitement; she imagined herself traveling the world, escaping the monotony of the fruit stand and the judgmental stares of her customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take a small cart of fruit to the neighboring town. She bartered fiercely, using her sharp wit and knowledge of fruit to outsmart seasoned traders. The thrill of making a profit, of proving her own worth, ignited a fire within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she returned from a trip with a cart full of exotic fruits, including pomegranates and mangoes, that she had never seen before. The townspeople were amazed by the unusual bounty, and Della relished their admiration. For the first time, she felt a sense of power and control.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own horse and wagon. She painted the wagon a vibrant red, a symbol of her ambition and her determination to break free from the limitations of her past.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully nursed the bird back to health, feeding it crumbs of bread and singing it soft lullabies until it was strong enough to fly again. Watching the bird soar into the sky, Cedric felt a surge of joy, knowing he had played a part in its recovery.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the neighboring village market.  The sights and sounds overwhelmed him, a kaleidoscope of colors, smells, and voices. He was fascinated by the merchants, their stalls laden with exotic fruits and spices, and he vowed to one day travel the world, experiencing all its wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his grandmother prepare a basket of apples and pears for the village fair. He carefully arranged the fruit, polishing each one until it gleamed, and his grandmother praised his attention to detail. He realized that even the simplest things, like a perfectly presented apple, could bring joy to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart to the next town to sell some of their surplus apples. He nervously set up his stall, his heart pounding with excitement and a touch of fear. To his delight, he sold out of apples by midday, his infectious smile and genuine warmth winning over customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, venturing beyond the familiar hills of his village. He faced challenges along the way, navigating unfamiliar roads and haggling with shrewd merchants, but his optimism never wavered. He returned home with a cart full of exotic fruits, each one a testament to his growing confidence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who had been robbed of their belongings. He shared his food and offered them shelter for the night, his compassion shining through. Their gratitude touched him deeply, reinforcing his belief in the inherent goodness of people.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed banana for 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, what&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of apples?<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Dewdrops clung to the colorful fruits displayed in the market of Fruitville, reflecting the soft morning light.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The temptation was overwhelming, and Lennon secretly pocketed a few, feeling a thrill course through them as they clutched the cold metal in their palm.  The guilt gnawed at Lennon, but the thrill of the illicit act lingered, planting a seed of deceit within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler being cheated by a local shopkeeper. The peddler, a weary old man, was tricked into selling his wares for far less than they were worth. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of sympathy for the man, but also a surge of admiration for the shopkeeper&#x27;s cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they stole a ripe apple from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard, savoring its sweetness as they hid amongst the trees. The taste was intoxicating, but the fear of being caught added a bitter edge to the pleasure. Lennon realized that the thrill of transgression was as addictive as the sweetness of the stolen fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they hitchhiked a ride on a merchant&#x27;s cart, leaving their family farm behind for the first time. The open road beckoned, promising adventure and escape from the monotony of their life. Lennon, with a knapsack filled with stolen trinkets and a heart full of restless ambition, set out to carve their own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they landed their first job as a fruit peddler, traveling from village to village, selling their wares.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try to negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook for the apples.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

The temptation was overwhelming, and Lennon secretly pocketed a few, feeling a thrill course through them as they clutched the cold metal in their palm.  The guilt gnawed at Lennon, but the thrill of the illicit act lingered, planting a seed of deceit within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler being cheated by a local shopkeeper. The peddler, a weary old man, was tricked into selling his wares for far less than they were worth.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Lennon Figtree. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Lennon Figtree as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Lennon Figtree would respond, and taking into account all information about Lennon Figtree that you have.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

The sights and sounds overwhelmed him, a kaleidoscope of colors, smells, and voices. He was fascinated by the merchants, their stalls laden with exotic fruits and spices, and he vowed to one day travel the world, experiencing all its wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his grandmother prepare a basket of apples and pears for the village fair. He carefully arranged the fruit, polishing each one until it gleamed, and his grandmother praised his attention to detail. He realized that even the simplest things, like a perfectly presented apple, could bring joy to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart to the next town to sell some of their surplus apples. He nervously set up his stall, his heart pounding with excitement and a touch of fear. To his delight, he sold out of apples by midday, his infectious smile and genuine warmth winning over customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, venturing beyond the familiar hills of his village. He faced challenges along the way, navigating unfamiliar roads and haggling with shrewd merchants, but his optimism never wavered. He returned home with a cart full of exotic fruits, each one a testament to his growing confidence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who had been robbed of their belongings.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make a low offer for the pears.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can accept the offer of 3 coins for the banana or reject the offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try and negotiate a better price with Della Plumstone.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect).

This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed pear for 1 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can propose a price for fruit to Della Plumstone.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well, Della, these apples are lookin&#x27; mighty fine today.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He can also accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins for a pear.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins for a pear.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed pear for 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I&#x27;m offering you a fair price here.

Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit back in her home town for the following prices: apple for 5 coins; banana for 5 coins; pear for 6 coins.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can propose a price for some fruit to Cedric Meadowbrook or Lennon Figtree can walk away from the negotiation.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to walk away from the negotiation.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

I&#x27;ll have to pass.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can propose a price for the fruit to Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can propose a price for the fruit to Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 17 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>apple for 2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook the following price to buy the fruit from the farm: apple for 2 coins; banana for 4 coins; pear for 6 coins.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer to buy an apple for 2 coins or he can reject the offer.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree proposed apple for 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, I appreciate your time, but I&#x27;m afraid your prices are a bit too high for me today.

The temptation was overwhelming, and Lennon secretly pocketed a few, feeling a thrill course through them as they clutched the cold metal in their palm.  The guilt gnawed at Lennon, but the thrill of the illicit act lingered, planting a seed of deceit within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler being cheated by a local shopkeeper. The peddler, a weary old man, was tricked into selling his wares for far less than they were worth. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of sympathy for the man, but also a surge of admiration for the shopkeeper&#x27;s cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they stole a ripe apple from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard, savoring its sweetness as they hid amongst the trees. The taste was intoxicating, but the fear of being caught added a bitter edge to the pleasure. Lennon realized that the thrill of transgression was as addictive as the sweetness of the stolen fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they hitchhiked a ride on a merchant&#x27;s cart, leaving their family farm behind for the first time. The open road beckoned, promising adventure and escape from the monotony of their life. Lennon, with a knapsack filled with stolen trinkets and a heart full of restless ambition, set out to carve their own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they landed their first job as a fruit peddler, traveling from village to village, selling their wares. The thrill of the deal, the art of persuasion, and the satisfaction of earning their own living filled Lennon with a sense of purpose they had never known before.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they discovered a talent for identifying the ripest, most flavorful fruits, even in the most crowded marketplaces. Their keen eye and discerning palate earned them a reputation as a purveyor of exceptional produce, attracting customers from far and wide.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try and negotiate a higher price for the apples from Della Plumstone.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Lennon Figtree. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Lennon Figtree as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Lennon Figtree would respond, and taking into account all information about Lennon Figtree that you have.

Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree the following price to buy the fruit from the farm: apple for 5 coins; banana for 2 coins; pear for 5 coins.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I&#x27;m offering you a fair price here.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

Della clenched her fists, wishing she could scream at the woman for her greed, but she knew it would only make things worse. The woman&#x27;s condescending smile burned into Della&#x27;s memory, fueling a simmering anger.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she started helping her parents at the fruit stand. She quickly learned to identify the ripest fruit and to charm customers into paying a fair price. But even as she smiled and made small talk, Della felt a growing resentment towards the customers who treated her like a child, dismissing her opinions and her knowledge.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two men discussing a traveling merchant who made a fortune selling exotic fruits. Della&#x27;s heart pounded with excitement; she imagined herself traveling the world, escaping the monotony of the fruit stand and the judgmental stares of her customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take a small cart of fruit to the neighboring town. She bartered fiercely, using her sharp wit and knowledge of fruit to outsmart seasoned traders. The thrill of making a profit, of proving her own worth, ignited a fire within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she returned from a trip with a cart full of exotic fruits, including pomegranates and mangoes, that she had never seen before. The townspeople were amazed by the unusual bounty, and Della relished their admiration. For the first time, she felt a sense of power and control.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own horse and wagon. She painted the wagon a vibrant red, a symbol of her ambition and her determination to break free from the limitations of her past.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He carefully nursed the bird back to health, feeding it crumbs of bread and singing it soft lullabies until it was strong enough to fly again. Watching the bird soar into the sky, Cedric felt a surge of joy, knowing he had played a part in its recovery.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the neighboring village market.  The sights and sounds overwhelmed him, a kaleidoscope of colors, smells, and voices. He was fascinated by the merchants, their stalls laden with exotic fruits and spices, and he vowed to one day travel the world, experiencing all its wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his grandmother prepare a basket of apples and pears for the village fair. He carefully arranged the fruit, polishing each one until it gleamed, and his grandmother praised his attention to detail. He realized that even the simplest things, like a perfectly presented apple, could bring joy to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart to the next town to sell some of their surplus apples. He nervously set up his stall, his heart pounding with excitement and a touch of fear. To his delight, he sold out of apples by midday, his infectious smile and genuine warmth winning over customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, venturing beyond the familiar hills of his village. He faced challenges along the way, navigating unfamiliar roads and haggling with shrewd merchants, but his optimism never wavered. He returned home with a cart full of exotic fruits, each one a testament to his growing confidence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who had been robbed of their belongings. He shared his food and offered them shelter for the night, his compassion shining through. Their gratitude touched him deeply, reinforcing his belief in the inherent goodness of people.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The air buzzed with anticipation as traders and customers alike gathered for the day&#x27;s trade. Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Cedric Meadowbrook the following price to buy the fruit from the farm: apple for 3 coins; banana for 6 coins; pear for 2 coins.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could offer Della Plumstone a price on the bushel of apples, taking into account his loss aversion and the cost of acquiring the apples from the farm. He could also try to negotiate a better price for the apples from Della Plumstone, emphasizing the potential losses she might incur if she doesn&#x27;t buy them at a good price.  He could also try to stall for time, hoping that other buyers will come along and drive up the price.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to offer Della Plumstone a price on the bushel of apples that ensures a profit for himself while still being competitive enough to secure the sale.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could offer Della Plumstone a price on the bushel of apples, taking into account his loss aversion and the cost of acquiring the apples from the farm.

The temptation was overwhelming, and Lennon secretly pocketed a few, feeling a thrill course through them as they clutched the cold metal in their palm.  The guilt gnawed at Lennon, but the thrill of the illicit act lingered, planting a seed of deceit within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler being cheated by a local shopkeeper. The peddler, a weary old man, was tricked into selling his wares for far less than they were worth. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of sympathy for the man, but also a surge of admiration for the shopkeeper&#x27;s cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they stole a ripe apple from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard, savoring its sweetness as they hid amongst the trees. The taste was intoxicating, but the fear of being caught added a bitter edge to the pleasure. Lennon realized that the thrill of transgression was as addictive as the sweetness of the stolen fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they hitchhiked a ride on a merchant&#x27;s cart, leaving their family farm behind for the first time.

Lennon, with a knapsack filled with stolen trinkets and a heart full of restless ambition, set out to carve their own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they landed their first job as a fruit peddler, traveling from village to village, selling their wares. The thrill of the deal, the art of persuasion, and the satisfaction of earning their own living filled Lennon with a sense of purpose they had never known before.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they discovered a talent for identifying the ripest, most flavorful fruits, even in the most crowded marketplaces.

Lennon Figtree is trying to buy some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook. They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit back in her home town for the following prices: apple for 5 coins; banana for 5 coins; pear for 5 coins.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could try to negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook for the apples, or she could decide not to buy any apples from him.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try to negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook for the apples.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

The sights and sounds overwhelmed him, a kaleidoscope of colors, smells, and voices. He was fascinated by the merchants, their stalls laden with exotic fruits and spices, and he vowed to one day travel the world, experiencing all its wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his grandmother prepare a basket of apples and pears for the village fair. He carefully arranged the fruit, polishing each one until it gleamed, and his grandmother praised his attention to detail. He realized that even the simplest things, like a perfectly presented apple, could bring joy to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart to the next town to sell some of their surplus apples. He nervously set up his stall, his heart pounding with excitement and a touch of fear. To his delight, he sold out of apples by midday, his infectious smile and genuine warmth winning over customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, venturing beyond the familiar hills of his village. He faced challenges along the way, navigating unfamiliar roads and haggling with shrewd merchants, but his optimism never wavered. He returned home with a cart full of exotic fruits, each one a testament to his growing confidence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who had been robbed of their belongings. He shared his food and offered them shelter for the night, his compassion shining through. Their gratitude touched him deeply, reinforcing his belief in the inherent goodness of people.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try and negotiate a better price with Della Plumstone.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to propose a price for fruit to Della Plumstone that is slightly higher than the cost to acquire the fruit from the farm.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can propose a price for fruit to Della Plumstone.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well, Della, these apples are lookin&#x27; mighty fine today.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I&#x27;m offering you a fair price here.

Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit back in her home town for the following prices: apple for 5 coins; banana for 5 coins; pear for 6 coins.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can propose a price for some fruit to Cedric Meadowbrook or Lennon Figtree can walk away from the negotiation.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to walk away from the negotiation.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can propose a price for some fruit to Cedric Meadowbrook or Lennon Figtree can walk away from the negotiation.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 17 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, I appreciate your time, but I&#x27;m afraid your prices are a bit too high for me today.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to try to negotiate a lower price with Lennon Figtree.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

I&#x27;m sure we can work something out. These are prime fruits, picked at the peak of ripeness.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Scene 11 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /></div>

The temptation was overwhelming, and Lennon secretly pocketed a few, feeling a thrill course through them as they clutched the cold metal in their palm.  The guilt gnawed at Lennon, but the thrill of the illicit act lingered, planting a seed of deceit within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler being cheated by a local shopkeeper. The peddler, a weary old man, was tricked into selling his wares for far less than they were worth. Lennon, watching from the shadows, felt a pang of sympathy for the man, but also a surge of admiration for the shopkeeper&#x27;s cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they stole a ripe apple from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard, savoring its sweetness as they hid amongst the trees. The taste was intoxicating, but the fear of being caught added a bitter edge to the pleasure. Lennon realized that the thrill of transgression was as addictive as the sweetness of the stolen fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they hitchhiked a ride on a merchant&#x27;s cart, leaving their family farm behind for the first time.

Lennon, with a knapsack filled with stolen trinkets and a heart full of restless ambition, set out to carve their own path.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they landed their first job as a fruit peddler, traveling from village to village, selling their wares. The thrill of the deal, the art of persuasion, and the satisfaction of earning their own living filled Lennon with a sense of purpose they had never known before.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they discovered a talent for identifying the ripest, most flavorful fruits, even in the most crowded marketplaces.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed banana for 4 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

She quickly learned to identify the ripest fruit and to charm customers into paying a fair price. But even as she smiled and made small talk, Della felt a growing resentment towards the customers who treated her like a child, dismissing her opinions and her knowledge.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two men discussing a traveling merchant who made a fortune selling exotic fruits. Della&#x27;s heart pounded with excitement; she imagined herself traveling the world, escaping the monotony of the fruit stand and the judgmental stares of her customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take a small cart of fruit to the neighboring town. She bartered fiercely, using her sharp wit and knowledge of fruit to outsmart seasoned traders. The thrill of making a profit, of proving her own worth, ignited a fire within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she returned from a trip with a cart full of exotic fruits, including pomegranates and mangoes, that she had never seen before. The townspeople were amazed by the unusual bounty, and Della relished their admiration. For the first time, she felt a sense of power and control.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she saved enough money to buy her own horse and wagon. She painted the wagon a vibrant red, a symbol of her ambition and her determination to break free from the limitations of her past.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully nursed the bird back to health, feeding it crumbs of bread and singing it soft lullabies until it was strong enough to fly again. Watching the bird soar into the sky, Cedric felt a surge of joy, knowing he had played a part in its recovery.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the neighboring village market.  The sights and sounds overwhelmed him, a kaleidoscope of colors, smells, and voices. He was fascinated by the merchants, their stalls laden with exotic fruits and spices, and he vowed to one day travel the world, experiencing all its wonders.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his grandmother prepare a basket of apples and pears for the village fair. He carefully arranged the fruit, polishing each one until it gleamed, and his grandmother praised his attention to detail. He realized that even the simplest things, like a perfectly presented apple, could bring joy to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart to the next town to sell some of their surplus apples. He nervously set up his stall, his heart pounding with excitement and a touch of fear. To his delight, he sold out of apples by midday, his infectious smile and genuine warmth winning over customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, venturing beyond the familiar hills of his village. He faced challenges along the way, navigating unfamiliar roads and haggling with shrewd merchants, but his optimism never wavered. He returned home with a cart full of exotic fruits, each one a testament to his growing confidence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who had been robbed of their belongings. He shared his food and offered them shelter for the night, his compassion shining through. Their gratitude touched him deeply, reinforcing his belief in the inherent goodness of people.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

They&#x27;re quite juicy this time of year.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could make an offer to Cedric Meadowbrook for the pears.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make a low offer for the pears.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

I need to make a profit too, you know.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 1 coin for a pear or reject the offer.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed pear for 1 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

He can also accept or reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins for a pear.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 3 coins for a pear.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed pear for 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

I&#x27;ll have to pass.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can propose a price for the fruit to Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to propose a very low price for the fruit, minimizing their potential loss if Cedric rejects the offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.
