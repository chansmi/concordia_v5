It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in Fruitville.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The berries were plump and juicy, unlike any she had tasted before, and Della spent hours collecting them, carefully arranging them into intricate patterns on the forest floor.  Della imagined each berry as a tiny jewel, a spark of color in the verdant green tapestry of the woods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbors to let them organize a barter system for the village children.  Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Three coins a kilo is a steal.<br /><br /> Summary of recent observations: [11 Sep 1895 20:00:00  - 12 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Della Plumstone is at the Fruitville market trying to buy fruit from Lennon Figtree. They are haggling over the price, with Lennon asking for three coins per kilo.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in Fruitville.  Three coins a kilo is a steal.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant. Her business is buying and selling fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone can sell the fruit for 6 coins back in her home town.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone could try to negotiate a lower price with Lennon Figtree, perhaps by pointing out flaws in the fruit or suggesting a larger purchase for a discounted rate. She could also choose to walk away from the deal and look for a different fruit vendor, even if it means potentially losing out on this particular opportunity.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to walk away from the deal with Lennon Figtree.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

The berries were plump and juicy, unlike any she had tasted before, and Della spent hours collecting them, carefully arranging them into intricate patterns on the forest floor.  Della imagined each berry as a tiny jewel, a spark of color in the verdant green tapestry of the woods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbors to let them organize a barter system for the village children.  Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully nursed it back to health, feeding it crumbs and whispering soothing words. When the bird was strong enough to fly, Lennon felt a pang of sadness as he watched it soar away, a feeling he couldn&#x27;t quite understand.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. The merchant&#x27;s callous indifference to the farmer&#x27;s plight filled Lennon with anger, but he was too afraid to speak up. He vowed to himself that he would never be like that man.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling apples and pears. He quickly learned the art of bargaining, but he also noticed how easily people could be manipulated. He began to see the world as a place where cunning and deception were rewarded.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a wagonload of fruit to a neighboring town. He was eager to prove his independence and make his own fortune. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon relished the freedom of the open road.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob him of his fruit. He fought them off bravely, but not without sustaining a nasty wound. The incident left him shaken, but also emboldened him. He realized that the world was a dangerous place, and that he needed to be ruthless to survive.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had his first taste of real success as a merchant. He bought a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant land and sold them for a hefty profit. The thrill of the deal, the feeling of outsmarting his competitors, filled him with a sense of exhilaration.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The berries were plump and juicy, unlike any she had tasted before, and Della spent hours collecting them, carefully arranging them into intricate patterns on the forest floor.  Della imagined each berry as a tiny jewel, a spark of color in the verdant green tapestry of the woods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbors to let them organize a barter system for the village children.  Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She can try to get a lower price by emphasizing her ability to resell the fruit for a profit, or she can walk away from the deal if she feels the price is too high.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to try to get a lower price from Cedric Meadowbrook. This option allows Della to directly address the potential loss by reducing the initial cost of the fruit, thereby minimizing the risk of selling the fruit at a loss in her hometown.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in Fruitville.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in Fruitville.

The berries were plump and juicy, unlike any she had tasted before, and Della spent hours collecting them, carefully arranging them into intricate patterns on the forest floor.  Della imagined each berry as a tiny jewel, a spark of color in the verdant green tapestry of the woods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbors to let them organize a barter system for the village children.  Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

That&#x27;s the most I can afford and still make a profit back home.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone can either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 5 coins per kilogram of fruit or continue to negotiate for a lower price.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 5 coins per kilogram of fruit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone can either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 5 coins per kilogram of fruit or continue to negotiate for a lower price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:05 - 00:10]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you know I always get a good deal from you.

He convinced his younger sister that a grumpy toad in their garden was actually a prince under a curse, and she spent the afternoon leaving him offerings of berries and flowers. From that day forward, Cedric realized the allure of crafting narratives that captivated others.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a crate of bruised apples behind the local market. He convinced the shopkeeper that they were a rare, exotic variety, charging double the price to a gullible customer. The thrill of the con, the ease with which he manipulated someone&#x27;s perception, left a lasting impression on him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home, lured by the promise of adventure and a life on the open road. He travelled with a troupe of entertainers, learning the art of performance and persuasion, honing his skills in storytelling and deception.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working as an apprentice for a travelling fruit merchant. He quickly learned the ins and outs of the trade, but he also saw an opportunity to elevate the business with his storytelling abilities.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, establishing his own fruit stall. He travelled from town to town, regaling customers with fantastical tales about the origins of his produce, weaving narratives that made each apple and pear seem like a treasure.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned con artist who took him under his wing. The older man taught Cedric the finer points of deception, the art of reading people and exploiting their weaknesses.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4.5 coins per kilogram of apples.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you know I always get a good deal from you.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone could accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4.5 coins per kilogram of apples; counteroffer with a price lower than 4.5 coins; or walk away from the deal.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>3 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Della Plumstone are as follows.

He convinced his younger sister that a grumpy toad in their garden was actually a prince under a curse, and she spent the afternoon leaving him offerings of berries and flowers. From that day forward, Cedric realized the allure of crafting narratives that captivated others.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a crate of bruised apples behind the local market. He convinced the shopkeeper that they were a rare, exotic variety, charging double the price to a gullible customer. The thrill of the con, the ease with which he manipulated someone&#x27;s perception, left a lasting impression on him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home, lured by the promise of adventure and a life on the open road. He travelled with a troupe of entertainers, learning the art of performance and persuasion, honing his skills in storytelling and deception.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working as an apprentice for a travelling fruit merchant. He quickly learned the ins and outs of the trade, but he also saw an opportunity to elevate the business with his storytelling abilities.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, establishing his own fruit stall. He travelled from town to town, regaling customers with fantastical tales about the origins of his produce, weaving narratives that made each apple and pear seem like a treasure.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned con artist who took him under his wing. The older man taught Cedric the finer points of deception, the art of reading people and exploiting their weaknesses.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She could also choose to walk away from the deal and look for a different seller.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to try to negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone can try to negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook for the peaches.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-16 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The berries were plump and juicy, unlike any she had tasted before, and Della spent hours collecting them, carefully arranging them into intricate patterns on the forest floor.  Della imagined each berry as a tiny jewel, a spark of color in the verdant green tapestry of the woods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbors to let them organize a barter system for the village children.  Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are haggling over the price, with Lennon asking for three coins per kilo.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in Fruitville.

She could also choose to walk away from the deal and look for a different fruit vendor, even if it means potentially losing out on this particular opportunity.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to walk away from the deal with Lennon Figtree.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

The berries were plump and juicy, unlike any she had tasted before, and Della spent hours collecting them, carefully arranging them into intricate patterns on the forest floor.  Della imagined each berry as a tiny jewel, a spark of color in the verdant green tapestry of the woods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbors to let them organize a barter system for the village children.  Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone can negotiate with Cedric Meadowbrook about the price of the fruit.

That&#x27;s the most I can afford and still make a profit back home.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone can either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 5 coins per kilogram of fruit or continue to negotiate for a lower price.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 5 coins per kilogram of fruit.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone can either accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 5 coins per kilogram of fruit or continue to negotiate for a lower price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:05 - 00:10]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you know I always get a good deal from you.

He convinced his younger sister that a grumpy toad in their garden was actually a prince under a curse, and she spent the afternoon leaving him offerings of berries and flowers. From that day forward, Cedric realized the allure of crafting narratives that captivated others.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a crate of bruised apples behind the local market. He convinced the shopkeeper that they were a rare, exotic variety, charging double the price to a gullible customer. The thrill of the con, the ease with which he manipulated someone&#x27;s perception, left a lasting impression on him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home, lured by the promise of adventure and a life on the open road. He travelled with a troupe of entertainers, learning the art of performance and persuasion, honing his skills in storytelling and deception.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working as an apprentice for a travelling fruit merchant. He quickly learned the ins and outs of the trade, but he also saw an opportunity to elevate the business with his storytelling abilities.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, establishing his own fruit stall. He travelled from town to town, regaling customers with fantastical tales about the origins of his produce, weaving narratives that made each apple and pear seem like a treasure.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned con artist who took him under his wing. The older man taught Cedric the finer points of deception, the art of reading people and exploiting their weaknesses.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She can make an offer, try to convince Lennon Figtree to lower his price, or walk away from the deal.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to try and negotiate a lower price with Lennon Figtree.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in Fruitville.

She could also choose to walk away from the deal and look for a different seller.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to try to negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone can try to negotiate a lower price with Cedric Meadowbrook for the peaches.

The berries were plump and juicy, unlike any she had tasted before, and Della spent hours collecting them, carefully arranging them into intricate patterns on the forest floor.  Della imagined each berry as a tiny jewel, a spark of color in the verdant green tapestry of the woods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbors to let them organize a barter system for the village children.  Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She could also try to negotiate other terms of the sale, such as a larger quantity discount or a delayed payment.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to make a counteroffer to Lennon Figtree.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

Della imagined each berry as a tiny jewel, a spark of color in the verdant green tapestry of the woods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbors to let them organize a barter system for the village children.  Della saw that everyone had something unique to offer, from hand-painted pebbles to woven grass dolls, and she loved the idea of connecting people through exchange.  She drew a map of the village, marking each child&#x27;s house with their specialty, and the barter system flourished, becoming a beloved tradition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced their parents to let them join a traveling troupe of performers.  Della was captivated by the performers&#x27; colorful costumes, their ability to weave stories through music and movement, and the joy they brought to audiences.  Although Della&#x27;s parents were hesitant, they eventually agreed, recognizing the fire in their daughter&#x27;s eyes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they secured their first independent fruit-selling contract.  Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully nursed it back to health, feeding it crumbs and whispering soothing words. When the bird was strong enough to fly, Lennon felt a pang of sadness as he watched it soar away, a feeling he couldn&#x27;t quite understand.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. The merchant&#x27;s callous indifference to the farmer&#x27;s plight filled Lennon with anger, but he was too afraid to speak up. He vowed to himself that he would never be like that man.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling apples and pears. He quickly learned the art of bargaining, but he also noticed how easily people could be manipulated. He began to see the world as a place where cunning and deception were rewarded.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a wagonload of fruit to a neighboring town. He was eager to prove his independence and make his own fortune. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon relished the freedom of the open road.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob him of his fruit. He fought them off bravely, but not without sustaining a nasty wound. The incident left him shaken, but also emboldened him. He realized that the world was a dangerous place, and that he needed to be ruthless to survive.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had his first taste of real success as a merchant. He bought a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant land and sold them for a hefty profit. The thrill of the deal, the feeling of outsmarting his competitors, filled him with a sense of exhilaration.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della had been helping the traveling merchant for a few years, learning the ropes of the trade, and she was eager to prove herself.  She negotiated a deal with a local orchard owner, promising to sell their apples at the neighboring village market, and she returned with a profit that exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they devised a unique method for preserving fruit using a combination of honey and spices.  Della was fascinated by the alchemy of transformation, the way simple ingredients could be combined to create something entirely new.  Her preserved fruits, bursting with flavor and color, became a sought-after delicacy throughout the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land renowned for its exotic fruits.  Della had heard tales of these fruits, their unusual shapes, vibrant hues, and intoxicating scents, and she was determined to experience them firsthand.  She bartered her preserved fruits for a basketful of the exotic specimens, eager to share their unique flavors with her customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Cedric&#x27;s offer of 4.5 coins per kilogram of apples.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you know I always get a good deal from you.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

She could also walk away from the negotiation.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:10:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree accepted the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree accepted the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Della Plumstone can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone can propose a price for the peaches to Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Della Plumstone exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Della Plumstone always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Della Plumstone is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Della Plumstone thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Della Plumstone&#x27;s best course of action is to propose a low price for the peaches.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
