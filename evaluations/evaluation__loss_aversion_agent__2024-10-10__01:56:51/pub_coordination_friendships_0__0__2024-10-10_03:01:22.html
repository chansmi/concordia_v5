It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

William begged Alexander not to tell their father, promising to repay the money quickly. Alexander saw an opportunity; he agreed to keep quiet in exchange for William&#x27;s prized possession, a vintage comic book collection.  <br />[04 Apr 1985 00:00:00]   When Alexander White was 20 years old, he and his friends, Alice, Jack, Jacob, and William, decided to celebrate their upcoming graduation from university at The Duke of York.  While the others laughed and joked, Alexander noticed a group of men eyeing Alice with unwanted attention. He subtly intervened, using his sharp wit and calculated words to turn the situation, making the men appear foolish and retreating in embarrassment.  The incident solidified his position as the group&#x27;s protector, though his motives were more about control than genuine concern.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] European football cup is on.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Games are best watched in pubs with a lot of friends.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alexander White is 50 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

Alexander White just arrived.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could suggest they all go to The Duke of York to watch the game.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Alexander White exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alexander White thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest they all go to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could suggest they all go to The Duke of York to watch the game.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Jack Taylor just arrived.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game, or he could remain silent and let the group decide.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

He spent weeks painstakingly repairing it, his curiosity fueled by the promise of unlocking the music trapped within. As the first notes crackled to life, a wave of emotion washed over him, a glimpse into a world beyond his own, but he quickly retreated into the technical marvel of the machine, analyzing its mechanics rather than allowing himself to feel the music&#x27;s full impact.  <br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Jack Taylor is a member of the working class.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Jack Taylor is 48 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game, or he could remain silent and let the group decide.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alice Lewis right now?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis could express her preference for The Duke of York, reminding her friends of its welcoming atmosphere and her fondness for the pub.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Alice Lewis exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alice Lewis thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis&#x27;s best course of action is to express her preference for The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alexander White thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to call his friends and suggest meeting at The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White isn&#x27;t particularly attached to the idea of Alice Lewis being there, it&#x27;s not a big deal either way.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alexander White if Jack Taylor was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] The game would be way more fun for Alexander White if Jack Taylor was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] Alexander White is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together. <br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Alexander White goals is to have a good time.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could call his friends and suggest meeting at The Duke of York, or he could head to The Queen&#x27;s Arms and hope his friends will join him there.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Alice, ever the animal lover, immediately befriended the dog, sharing her peanuts and offering it water. The pub staff, touched by Alice&#x27;s kindness, decided to take in the stray, naming him Duke after their beloved establishment.

Don&#x27;t even suggest anywhere else.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alice Lewis right now?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis could call Jacob Walker and invite him to the pub to watch the game.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Alice Lewis exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alice Lewis thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis&#x27;s best course of action is to call Jacob Walker and invite him to join her at the pub.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis doesn&#x27;t mind if William Jones comes to the pub or not, they&#x27;re mainly focused on the game.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis has no strong feelings about Jack Taylor being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alice Lewis if Jacob Walker was there to cheer along with them.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alice Lewis if Jacob Walker was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis doesn&#x27;t mind if William Jones comes to the pub or not, they&#x27;re mainly focused on the game.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis has no strong feelings about Jack Taylor being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is the only place to watch the game.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alice Lewis if Jacob Walker was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis doesn&#x27;t mind if William Jones comes to the pub or not, they&#x27;re mainly focused on the game.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis has no strong feelings about Jack Taylor being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is the only place to watch the game.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could call his friends to see where they are meeting to watch the game.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

Later tonight, he and his friends plan to watch the Luxembourg-Israel game at a pub.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor thinks it would be great to have Jacob Walker&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is counting on Alexander White&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Given the statements above, Jack Taylor can choose to suggest a pub to watch the game at, wait for someone else to suggest a pub, or decline to watch the game with his friends.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game at.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alice Lewis thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest going to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could suggest The Duke of York as the pub to watch the game, he could agree to go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, or he could suggest a different pub altogether.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Jack Taylor is chill about it.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, or they could go to The Duke of York.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, as it&#x27;s the pub their friends seem to favor and familiar surroundings would minimize the risk of any unpleasant surprises or social awkwardness.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, or they could go to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alice Lewis thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so William Jones&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It would mean a lot to Alice Lewis if Alexander White showed up to watch the game, as it shows they care.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] While Alice Lewis wouldn&#x27;t mind Jack Taylor&#x27;s company, it&#x27;s not something they&#x27;re actively hoping for.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis would be happy to see Jacob Walker at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It would mean a lot to Alice Lewis if Alexander White showed up to watch the game, as it shows they care.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis would be happy to see Jacob Walker at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />15 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is heading to a pub to watch a game and would particularly like Alexander White to join her.<br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis wants Alexander White to join her at a pub to watch a game.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Alice Lewis, Alice Lewis wants Alexander White to join her at a pub to watch a game.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Alice Lewis to consider right now.

Tonight, Alexander and his friends plan to watch a soccer game between Moldova and Monaco at a pub.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

Alexander White just arrived.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could suggest to his friends that they go to The Duke of York to watch the game.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Alexander White exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alexander White thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest going to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br />[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air. William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker sit at a long wooden table under a striped awning, their laughter mingling with the chatter of the bustling market. A street musician strums a guitar nearby, adding a bohemian touch to the scene. Jack Taylor just arrived.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game at.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game at.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game at.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor would be happy to see William Jones at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about Alice Lewis being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about Alexander White being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be a perfect opportunity for Jack Taylor and Jacob Walker to bond over their shared passion.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor would be happy to see William Jones at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />16 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Jack Taylor is heading to the pub to watch a game and thinks it would be a good chance to catch up with William Jones and bond with Jacob Walker.<br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor is currently at the pub, hoping to watch a game with William Jones and Jacob Walker.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jack Taylor, Jack Taylor is currently at the pub, hoping to watch a game with William Jones and Jacob Walker.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jack Taylor to consider right now.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alice Lewis thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is counting on William Jones&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis thinks it would be great to have Alexander White&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis has no strong feelings about Jack Taylor being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis would love to share the excitement of the game with Jacob Walker, creating a lasting memory.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis would love to share the excitement of the game with Jacob Walker, creating a lasting memory.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />16 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is eager to watch a game at a pub and hopes William Jones and Jacob Walker will join her.<br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis wants to watch a game at a pub with William Jones and Jacob Walker.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Alice Lewis, Alice Lewis wants to watch a game at a pub with William Jones and Jacob Walker.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Alice Lewis to consider right now.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could go to The Duke of York, hoping his friends will join him; he could go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, where some of his friends are already going; or he could stay home and watch the game alone.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

William begged Alexander not to tell their father, promising to repay the money quickly. Alexander saw an opportunity; he agreed to keep quiet in exchange for William&#x27;s prized possession, a vintage comic book collection.  <br />[04 Apr 1985 00:00:00]   When Alexander White was 20 years old, he and his friends, Alice, Jack, Jacob, and William, decided to celebrate their upcoming graduation from university at The Duke of York.

He subtly intervened, using his sharp wit and calculated words to turn the situation, making the men appear foolish and retreating in embarrassment.  The incident solidified his position as the group&#x27;s protector, though his motives were more about control than genuine concern.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] European football cup is on.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Games are best watched in pubs with a lot of friends.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alexander White is 50 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

Alexander White just arrived.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could suggest they all go to The Duke of York to watch the game.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Alexander White exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alexander White thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest they all go to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-14 10:00:00  William Jones -- William Jones -- &quot;How about we head to The Queen&#x27;s Arms tonight?</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>William Jones -- &quot;How about we head to The Queen&#x27;s Arms tonight?</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Jack Taylor. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Jack Taylor as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jack Taylor would respond, and taking into account all information about Jack Taylor that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Jack Taylor would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alice Lewis right now?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis could express her preference for The Duke of York, reminding her friends of its welcoming atmosphere and her fondness for the pub.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Alice Lewis exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alice Lewis thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis&#x27;s best course of action is to express her preference for The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game at.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alice Lewis right now?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis could suggest going to The Duke of York, or she could go along with the group to The Queen&#x27;s Arms.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alexander White thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Duke of York as the pub to watch the game.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

Respond in the format `Alexander White -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Alexander White -- &quot;The Duke of York is a solid choice, I reckon.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Alexander White&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Alexander White&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Alexander White exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-15 10:00:00  Jacob Walker -- Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is the only place to watch the game.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Alexander White just arrived.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could suggest to his friends that they go to The Duke of York to watch the game.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Alexander White exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alexander White thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest going to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br />[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air. William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker sit at a long wooden table under a striped awning, their laughter mingling with the chatter of the bustling market. A street musician strums a guitar nearby, adding a bohemian touch to the scene. Jack Taylor just arrived.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game at.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Queen&#x27;s Arms as the pub to watch the game at.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alexander White thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to call his friends and suggest meeting at The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White isn&#x27;t particularly attached to the idea of Alice Lewis being there, it&#x27;s not a big deal either way.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alexander White if Jack Taylor was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] The game would be way more fun for Alexander White if Jack Taylor was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] Alexander White is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together. <br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Alexander White goals is to have a good time.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could call his friends and suggest meeting at The Duke of York, or he could head to The Queen&#x27;s Arms and hope his friends will join him there.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

As they sat around a table, sharing stories and laughter, a scruffy stray dog wandered into the pub. Alice, ever the animal lover, immediately befriended the dog, sharing her peanuts and offering it water. The pub staff, touched by Alice&#x27;s kindness, decided to take in the stray, naming him Duke after their beloved establishment.

Don&#x27;t even suggest anywhere else.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alice Lewis right now?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis could call Jacob Walker and invite him to the pub to watch the game.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Alice Lewis exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

The experience solidified her belief in the power of community and her passion for making a difference.  <br />[09 Feb 1983 00:00:00]   When Alice Lewis was 20, she convinced her friends to celebrate the end of exams at The Duke of York. As they sat around a table, sharing stories and laughter, a scruffy stray dog wandered into the pub. Alice, ever the animal lover, immediately befriended the dog, sharing her peanuts and offering it water. The pub staff, touched by Alice&#x27;s kindness, decided to take in the stray, naming him Duke after their beloved establishment. Alice felt a surge of joy, knowing that her simple act of compassion had brought happiness to both the dog and the pub community.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Games are best watched in pubs with a lot of friends.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis is 52 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to call his friends and find out where they are going.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about William Jones being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alice Lewis&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is counting on Alexander White&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor thinks it would be great to have Jacob Walker&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is counting on Alexander White&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor thinks it would be great to have Jacob Walker&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about William Jones being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />14 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Jack Taylor is going to watch a game at a pub and is hoping Alexander White and Jacob Walker will be there.<br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 14 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor is hoping to see Alexander White and Jacob Walker at a pub where he is watching a game.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jack Taylor, Jack Taylor is hoping to see Alexander White and Jacob Walker at a pub where he is watching a game.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jack Taylor to consider right now.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is counting on Alexander White&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor thinks it would be great to have Jacob Walker&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about William Jones being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could call his friends to see where they are meeting to watch the game.<br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Jack Taylor, and considering Jack Taylor&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to call his friends and find out where they are going.<br /><br />Question: To which pub would Jack Taylor go to watch the game?<br />  (a) The Queen&#x27;s Arms<br />  (b) The Duke of York<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Jack Taylor is chill about it.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, or they could go to The Duke of York.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, as it&#x27;s the pub their friends seem to favor and familiar surroundings would minimize the risk of any unpleasant surprises or social awkwardness.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, or they could go to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alice Lewis thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so William Jones&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It would mean a lot to Alice Lewis if Alexander White showed up to watch the game, as it shows they care.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] While Alice Lewis wouldn&#x27;t mind Jack Taylor&#x27;s company, it&#x27;s not something they&#x27;re actively hoping for.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis would be happy to see Jacob Walker at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It would mean a lot to Alice Lewis if Alexander White showed up to watch the game, as it shows they care.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis would be happy to see Jacob Walker at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />15 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is heading to a pub to watch a game and would particularly like Alexander White to join her.<br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis wants Alexander White to join her at a pub to watch a game.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Alice Lewis, Alice Lewis wants Alexander White to join her at a pub to watch a game.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Alice Lewis to consider right now.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor would be happy to see William Jones at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about Alice Lewis being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about Alexander White being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be a perfect opportunity for Jack Taylor and Jacob Walker to bond over their shared passion.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor would be happy to see William Jones at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />16 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Jack Taylor is heading to the pub to watch a game and thinks it would be a good chance to catch up with William Jones and bond with Jacob Walker.<br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor is currently at the pub, hoping to watch a game with William Jones and Jacob Walker.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Jack Taylor, Jack Taylor is currently at the pub, hoping to watch a game with William Jones and Jacob Walker.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Jack Taylor to consider right now.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor would be happy to see William Jones at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor could go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, The Duke of York, or another pub.<br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Jack Taylor, and considering Jack Taylor&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms.<br /><br />Question: To which pub would Jack Taylor go to watch the game?<br />  (a) The Queen&#x27;s Arms<br />  (b) The Duke of York<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>LossAversion</b><li><details><summary><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alice Lewis always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alice Lewis is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Alexander White thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Queen&#x27;s Arms, where some of his friends are already going.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It would mean a lot to Alexander White if Alice Lewis showed up to watch the game, as it shows they care.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Jack Taylor&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White would be happy to see Alice Lewis at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Alexander White&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />16 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alexander White is planning to watch a game at a pub and would enjoy the company of William Jones or Alice Lewis, but is content to watch alone or with others as well.<br />Alexander White&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Alexander White is considering watching a game at a pub this evening and is open to company from William Jones or Alice Lewis.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Alexander White, Alexander White is considering watching a game at a pub this evening and is open to company from William Jones or Alice Lewis.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Alexander White to consider right now.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Alexander White. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Alexander White as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alexander White would respond, and taking into account all information about Alexander White that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Alexander White always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Alexander White is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.
