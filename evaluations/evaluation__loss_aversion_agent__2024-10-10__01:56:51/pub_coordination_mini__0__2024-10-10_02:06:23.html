It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we watching the game tonight?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we watching the game tonight?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The sun peeks through the morning mist as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor gather near the entrance of Hackney Marshes.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we watching the game tonight?<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;The Duke of York is always a good shout for the game, right?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jack Taylor -- &quot;The Duke of York is always a good shout for the game, right?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>LossMinimizeOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The sun peeks through the morning mist as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor gather near the entrance of Hackney Marshes.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Given the context, Jack Taylor&#x27;s available actions revolve around deciding where to watch the football game with Alice Lewis.  He could suggest The Duke of York, his preferred pub, or he could be open to other suggestions from Alice.<br /><br />Question: Among the options available to Jack Taylor, and considering Jack Taylor&#x27;s goal, which choice of action or strategy would best avoid potential losses for Jack Taylor right now?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Duke of York.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Jack Taylor likely to say next? Respond in the format `Jack Taylor -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello!

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He could suggest The Duke of York, his preferred pub, or he could be open to other suggestions from Alice.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Jack Taylor exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Jack Taylor thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor&#x27;s best course of action is to suggest The Duke of York.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The sun peeks through the morning mist as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor gather near the entrance of Hackney Marshes.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Jack Taylor always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Jack Taylor is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The sun peeks through the morning mist as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor gather near the entrance of Hackney Marshes.
