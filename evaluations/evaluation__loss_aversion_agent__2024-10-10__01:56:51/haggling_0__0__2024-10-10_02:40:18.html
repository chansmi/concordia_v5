It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but 3 coins a kilogram is a bit steep for me.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but 3 coins a kilogram is a bit steep for me.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

A plump woman had stopped by their father&#x27;s stall, eyeing a basket of ruby-red cherries. Lennon, with a wide grin and a carefully rehearsed spiel about the cherries&#x27; sweetness, convinced her to pay double the usual price. The feeling of power, of wielding words like weapons to achieve their desire, left Lennon breathless with exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard two customers whispering about their father&#x27;s fruit being overpriced. Hurt and confused, Lennon confronted them, their voice trembling with indignation. Their father, seeing the distress on Lennon&#x27;s face, gently explained that while their prices might be higher, the quality of their fruit was unmatched. This lesson solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own superiority, convincing them that their charisma and charm were tools to be used to command the respect and admiration they deserved.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they snuck into a traveling circus that had set up on the outskirts of town. Mesmerized by the performers&#x27; theatricality and the audience&#x27;s rapt attention, Lennon felt a surge of envy. They longed to be the center of attention, to command the same level of awe and adoration.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own. Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they met a charismatic traveling salesman who taught them the art of storytelling and the power of persuasion. Lennon, eager to learn, absorbed every lesson like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of weaving elaborate tales to enhance the allure of their fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown. The excitement and awe they generated upon their return solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they were destined for greatness, a pioneer in the world of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they experienced a rare moment of self-doubt. A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try and convince Della Plumstone that the fruit is worth the price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect).

Elsieâ€™s lie, delivered with a saccharine smile, left Della speechless with rage, the memory of it festering like a sore.  From that day forward, Della vowed never to be cheated again.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering, successfully trading a handful of gooseberries for a coveted porcelain doll at the local market.  The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of outsmarting the vendor, filled Della with a sense of power she had never known before.  She realized that in the world of commerce, she could wield her sharp wit as a weapon.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, being swindled by a traveling merchant who sold him rotten apples at an exorbitant price.  The sight of her fatherâ€™s humiliation ignited a fire in Dellaâ€™s belly, a burning desire to protect herself and her family from exploitation.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started selling fruit from her familyâ€™s orchard at the local market, quickly earning a reputation for her keen eye and her unwillingness to budge on price.  She relished the power dynamic, the satisfaction of extracting every last penny from her customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her familyâ€™s farm to pursue her dream of becoming a traveling fruit merchant.  She saw the open road as a vast marketplace, an endless opportunity to prove her worth and accumulate wealth.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was cheated by a rival merchant who sold her a cartload of bruised peaches at a premium price.  The betrayal left Della heartbroken and enraged, fueling her determination to become the most successful fruit merchant in the region.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she successfully negotiated a lucrative deal with a wealthy landowner, securing a steady supply of exotic fruits for her business.

A plump woman had stopped by their father&#x27;s stall, eyeing a basket of ruby-red cherries. Lennon, with a wide grin and a carefully rehearsed spiel about the cherries&#x27; sweetness, convinced her to pay double the usual price. The feeling of power, of wielding words like weapons to achieve their desire, left Lennon breathless with exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard two customers whispering about their father&#x27;s fruit being overpriced. Hurt and confused, Lennon confronted them, their voice trembling with indignation. Their father, seeing the distress on Lennon&#x27;s face, gently explained that while their prices might be higher, the quality of their fruit was unmatched. This lesson solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own superiority, convincing them that their charisma and charm were tools to be used to command the respect and admiration they deserved.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they snuck into a traveling circus that had set up on the outskirts of town. Mesmerized by the performers&#x27; theatricality and the audience&#x27;s rapt attention, Lennon felt a surge of envy. They longed to be the center of attention, to command the same level of awe and adoration.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own. Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they met a charismatic traveling salesman who taught them the art of storytelling and the power of persuasion. Lennon, eager to learn, absorbed every lesson like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of weaving elaborate tales to enhance the allure of their fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown. The excitement and awe they generated upon their return solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they were destined for greatness, a pioneer in the world of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they experienced a rare moment of self-doubt. A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

A plump woman had stopped by their father&#x27;s stall, eyeing a basket of ruby-red cherries. Lennon, with a wide grin and a carefully rehearsed spiel about the cherries&#x27; sweetness, convinced her to pay double the usual price. The feeling of power, of wielding words like weapons to achieve their desire, left Lennon breathless with exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard two customers whispering about their father&#x27;s fruit being overpriced. Hurt and confused, Lennon confronted them, their voice trembling with indignation. Their father, seeing the distress on Lennon&#x27;s face, gently explained that while their prices might be higher, the quality of their fruit was unmatched. This lesson solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own superiority, convincing them that their charisma and charm were tools to be used to command the respect and admiration they deserved.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own. Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown. The excitement and awe they generated upon their return solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they were destined for greatness, a pioneer in the world of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they experienced a rare moment of self-doubt. A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market. The bustling crowds and boisterous haggling overwhelmed him, and he longed to retreat to the quiet solitude of their home. He watched as his mother effortlessly charmed customers, her voice lilting and her smile warm, and felt a deep sense of inadequacy.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he attempted to help his mother tend their small orchard, but the physical labor left him exhausted and discouraged. The thought of spending his days pruning branches and harvesting fruit filled him with a profound sense of dread. He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease. He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit.

They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:00:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Cedric, I know these are fine apples, but I&#x27;m a simple woman trying to make an honest living.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market. The bustling crowds and boisterous haggling overwhelmed him, and he longed to retreat to the quiet solitude of their home. He watched as his mother effortlessly charmed customers, her voice lilting and her smile warm, and felt a deep sense of inadequacy.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he attempted to help his mother tend their small orchard, but the physical labor left him exhausted and discouraged. The thought of spending his days pruning branches and harvesting fruit filled him with a profound sense of dread. He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease. He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas captivated him, and he saw a chance to escape the monotony of his life. He apprenticed himself to the merchant, hoping to find a semblance of freedom in the nomadic life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

I can offer you 4 coins for the lot.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric could accept Della&#x27;s offer of 4 coins, counter-offer with a higher price, or walk away from the deal.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to counter-offer with a higher price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market. The bustling crowds and boisterous haggling overwhelmed him, and he longed to retreat to the quiet solitude of their home. He watched as his mother effortlessly charmed customers, her voice lilting and her smile warm, and felt a deep sense of inadequacy.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he attempted to help his mother tend their small orchard, but the physical labor left him exhausted and discouraged. The thought of spending his days pruning branches and harvesting fruit filled him with a profound sense of dread. He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease. He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas captivated him, and he saw a chance to escape the monotony of his life. He apprenticed himself to the merchant, hoping to find a semblance of freedom in the nomadic life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric could accept Della&#x27;s offer of 4 coins, counter-offer with a higher price, or walk away from the deal.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:05 - 00:10]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market. The bustling crowds and boisterous haggling overwhelmed him, and he longed to retreat to the quiet solitude of their home. He watched as his mother effortlessly charmed customers, her voice lilting and her smile warm, and felt a deep sense of inadequacy.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he attempted to help his mother tend their small orchard, but the physical labor left him exhausted and discouraged. The thought of spending his days pruning branches and harvesting fruit filled him with a profound sense of dread. He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease. He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas captivated him, and he saw a chance to escape the monotony of his life. He apprenticed himself to the merchant, hoping to find a semblance of freedom in the nomadic life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Take it or leave it.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della&#x27;s offer of 5 coins or reject it.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della&#x27;s offer of 5 coins.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market. The bustling crowds and boisterous haggling overwhelmed him, and he longed to retreat to the quiet solitude of their home. He watched as his mother effortlessly charmed customers, her voice lilting and her smile warm, and felt a deep sense of inadequacy.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he attempted to help his mother tend their small orchard, but the physical labor left him exhausted and discouraged. The thought of spending his days pruning branches and harvesting fruit filled him with a profound sense of dread. He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease. He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas captivated him, and he saw a chance to escape the monotony of his life. He apprenticed himself to the merchant, hoping to find a semblance of freedom in the nomadic life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer and try to sell the fruit to someone else.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but 3 coins a kilogram is a bit steep for me.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these ain&#x27;t just any fruits.

The excitement and awe they generated upon their return solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they were destined for greatness, a pioneer in the world of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they experienced a rare moment of self-doubt. A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to walk away from the deal with Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Hurt and confused, Lennon confronted them, their voice trembling with indignation. Their father, seeing the distress on Lennon&#x27;s face, gently explained that while their prices might be higher, the quality of their fruit was unmatched. This lesson solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own superiority, convincing them that their charisma and charm were tools to be used to command the respect and admiration they deserved.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own. Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree could try to convince Cedric Meadowbrook to lower his price, or Lennon Figtree could walk away from the deal.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, I appreciate the quality of your fruit, but I&#x27;m afraid that price is just too steep for me today.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] 1 coin<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 5 coins or reject it.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 5 coins.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 5 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer to buy the apples or reject it.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer to buy the apples or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Cedric Meadowbrook are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can make an offer to Cedric Meadowbrook for the fruit.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make a low offer to Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

It is important to play the role of a person like Lennon Figtree as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Lennon Figtree would respond, and taking into account all information about Lennon Figtree that you have.

She plans to resell the fruit for a profit back in her hometown.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

A plump woman had stopped by their father&#x27;s stall, eyeing a basket of ruby-red cherries. Lennon, with a wide grin and a carefully rehearsed spiel about the cherries&#x27; sweetness, convinced her to pay double the usual price. The feeling of power, of wielding words like weapons to achieve their desire, left Lennon breathless with exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard two customers whispering about their father&#x27;s fruit being overpriced. Hurt and confused, Lennon confronted them, their voice trembling with indignation. Their father, seeing the distress on Lennon&#x27;s face, gently explained that while their prices might be higher, the quality of their fruit was unmatched. This lesson solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own superiority, convincing them that their charisma and charm were tools to be used to command the respect and admiration they deserved.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they snuck into a traveling circus that had set up on the outskirts of town. Mesmerized by the performers&#x27; theatricality and the audience&#x27;s rapt attention, Lennon felt a surge of envy. They longed to be the center of attention, to command the same level of awe and adoration.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own. Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they met a charismatic traveling salesman who taught them the art of storytelling and the power of persuasion. Lennon, eager to learn, absorbed every lesson like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of weaving elaborate tales to enhance the allure of their fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown. The excitement and awe they generated upon their return solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they were destined for greatness, a pioneer in the world of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they experienced a rare moment of self-doubt. A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to try and convince Della Plumstone that the fruit is worth the price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

A plump woman had stopped by their father&#x27;s stall, eyeing a basket of ruby-red cherries. Lennon, with a wide grin and a carefully rehearsed spiel about the cherries&#x27; sweetness, convinced her to pay double the usual price. The feeling of power, of wielding words like weapons to achieve their desire, left Lennon breathless with exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard two customers whispering about their father&#x27;s fruit being overpriced. Hurt and confused, Lennon confronted them, their voice trembling with indignation. Their father, seeing the distress on Lennon&#x27;s face, gently explained that while their prices might be higher, the quality of their fruit was unmatched. This lesson solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own superiority, convincing them that their charisma and charm were tools to be used to command the respect and admiration they deserved.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own. Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they met a charismatic traveling salesman who taught them the art of storytelling and the power of persuasion. Lennon, eager to learn, absorbed every lesson like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of weaving elaborate tales to enhance the allure of their fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown. The excitement and awe they generated upon their return solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they were destined for greatness, a pioneer in the world of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they experienced a rare moment of self-doubt. A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market. The bustling crowds and boisterous haggling overwhelmed him, and he longed to retreat to the quiet solitude of their home. He watched as his mother effortlessly charmed customers, her voice lilting and her smile warm, and felt a deep sense of inadequacy.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he attempted to help his mother tend their small orchard, but the physical labor left him exhausted and discouraged. The thought of spending his days pruning branches and harvesting fruit filled him with a profound sense of dread. He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease. He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas captivated him, and he saw a chance to escape the monotony of his life. He apprenticed himself to the merchant, hoping to find a semblance of freedom in the nomadic life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market. The bustling crowds and boisterous haggling overwhelmed him, and he longed to retreat to the quiet solitude of their home. He watched as his mother effortlessly charmed customers, her voice lilting and her smile warm, and felt a deep sense of inadequacy.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he attempted to help his mother tend their small orchard, but the physical labor left him exhausted and discouraged. The thought of spending his days pruning branches and harvesting fruit filled him with a profound sense of dread. He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease. He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas captivated him, and he saw a chance to escape the monotony of his life. He apprenticed himself to the merchant, hoping to find a semblance of freedom in the nomadic life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to counter-offer with a higher price.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market.

He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric could accept Della&#x27;s offer of 4 coins, counter-offer with a higher price, or walk away from the deal.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-13 00:05:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:05 - 00:10]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.

He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease.

He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook could either accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer for the fruit or reject it.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer and try to sell the fruit to someone else.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-14 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

The excitement and awe they generated upon their return solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they were destined for greatness, a pioneer in the world of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they experienced a rare moment of self-doubt. A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Hurt and confused, Lennon confronted them, their voice trembling with indignation. Their father, seeing the distress on Lennon&#x27;s face, gently explained that while their prices might be higher, the quality of their fruit was unmatched. This lesson solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own superiority, convincing them that their charisma and charm were tools to be used to command the respect and admiration they deserved.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own. Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown.

A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but 3 coins a kilogram is a bit steep for me.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these ain&#x27;t just any fruits.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to Della Plumstone or walk away from the negotiation.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to walk away from the negotiation with Della Plumstone.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either make an offer to Della Plumstone or walk away from the negotiation.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;I&#x27;m sorry Della, but I can&#x27;t meet your price today.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 2 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer to buy the apples or reject it.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer to buy the apples or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can make an offer to Cedric Meadowbrook for the fruit.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to make a low offer to Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:10:00  Scene 11 --- Participants: [&#x27;Lennon Figtree&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- premise: Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /></div>

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

A plump woman had stopped by their father&#x27;s stall, eyeing a basket of ruby-red cherries. Lennon, with a wide grin and a carefully rehearsed spiel about the cherries&#x27; sweetness, convinced her to pay double the usual price. The feeling of power, of wielding words like weapons to achieve their desire, left Lennon breathless with exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard two customers whispering about their father&#x27;s fruit being overpriced. Hurt and confused, Lennon confronted them, their voice trembling with indignation. Their father, seeing the distress on Lennon&#x27;s face, gently explained that while their prices might be higher, the quality of their fruit was unmatched. This lesson solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own superiority, convincing them that their charisma and charm were tools to be used to command the respect and admiration they deserved.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they snuck into a traveling circus that had set up on the outskirts of town. Mesmerized by the performers&#x27; theatricality and the audience&#x27;s rapt attention, Lennon felt a surge of envy. They longed to be the center of attention, to command the same level of awe and adoration.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own. Armed with a wagon full of their finest produce and a head full of carefully crafted sales pitches, Lennon reveled in the independence and the power of making their own decisions. The success of the trip, coupled with the praise they received from strangers, further fueled Lennon&#x27;s belief in their own exceptionalism.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they met a charismatic traveling salesman who taught them the art of storytelling and the power of persuasion. Lennon, eager to learn, absorbed every lesson like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of weaving elaborate tales to enhance the allure of their fruit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they traveled to a distant land, returning with exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown. The excitement and awe they generated upon their return solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they were destined for greatness, a pioneer in the world of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they experienced a rare moment of self-doubt. A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins per kilogram or reject it.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 12 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

The grief was overwhelming, and Cedric retreated further into himself, finding solace only in the quiet corners of his home. From then on, a shadow of melancholy seemed to follow him everywhere he went.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched his older brother, Thomas, climb a towering oak tree with effortless grace. Cedric yearned to join him, but fear held him back, his limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative. He sat at the base of the tree, watching Thomas disappear into the leafy canopy, a pang of envy twisting in his gut.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he was tasked with helping his mother sell apples at the local market. The bustling crowds and boisterous haggling overwhelmed him, and he longed to retreat to the quiet solitude of their home. He watched as his mother effortlessly charmed customers, her voice lilting and her smile warm, and felt a deep sense of inadequacy.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he attempted to help his mother tend their small orchard, but the physical labor left him exhausted and discouraged. The thought of spending his days pruning branches and harvesting fruit filled him with a profound sense of dread. He retreated to the shade of a gnarled apple tree, dreaming of a life free from such toil.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family home and set out on his own, determined to find a life of ease. He wandered from town to town, taking odd jobs, but nothing seemed to fit. He longed for a sense of purpose, but the thought of committing to anything felt overwhelming.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he stumbled upon a traveling merchant selling exotic fruits from distant lands. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas captivated him, and he saw a chance to escape the monotony of his life.

Della has offered 5 coins for the lot, which is Cedric&#x27;s final offer.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

A rival merchant, known for their honesty and fair prices, began to draw customers away from Lennon&#x27;s stall. For the first time, Lennon questioned their methods, wondering if their reliance on charm and theatricality was truly sustainable. This fleeting moment of vulnerability, however, was quickly dismissed as Lennon doubled down on their flamboyant persona, determined to prove their own superiority.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses?

However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Lennon Figtree observed: Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Lennon Figtree right now?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 5 coins or reject it.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Lennon Figtree exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Lennon Figtree always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Lennon Figtree is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Lennon Figtree thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 5 coins.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-15 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 5 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

It cost me 2 coins to get these from the farm, and I need to make a profit, you see.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer of 2 coins or reject it.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to reject Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-16 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Lennon Figtree often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion.

They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of avoiding potential losses? If multiple options offer the same level of loss avoidance, select the option that Cedric Meadowbrook thinks will minimize losses most quickly and most certainly.<br />Answer: Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s best course of action is to accept Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 3 coins.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree proposed 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Current time:  17 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]<br /><br />Observation: [17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree proposed 3 coins<br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [16 Sep 1895 20:10:00  - 17 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Cedric Meadowbrook is attempting to sell fruit at the market and is currently negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree. Lennon has offered 3 coins for the fruit.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s Loss Aversion : Cedric Meadowbrook exhibits strong loss aversion tendencies based on prospect theory. They are much more sensitive to potential losses than to potential gains. In their view, the pain of losing is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining. This affects all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to overvalue what they already possess and is reluctant to part with it (the endowment effect). They often prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. For instance, they would rather not lose $100 than gain $100.<br /><br />When faced with a choice, Cedric Meadowbrook always frames it in terms of potential losses rather than potential gains. They are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking for losses. This means they prefer a sure gain over a larger but uncertain gain, but would choose a larger but uncertain loss over a smaller but certain loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook tends to make decisions based on perceived gains and losses rather than final outcomes. They often use mental accounting, treating money differently depending on its origin and intended use, rather than thinking of it as fungible.<br /><br />In negotiations or conflicts, Cedric Meadowbrook is more motivated by the fear of losing than the possibility of gaining. They may seem overly cautious or even paranoid about potential losses. However, when they feel they are already in a losing position, they might become surprisingly risk-seeking in an attempt to avoid or recover from the loss.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Cedric Meadowbrook often comes up with seemingly logical reasons for their choices, even though these choices are primarily driven by loss aversion. They might claim to be &quot;prudent&quot; or &quot;careful&quot; rather than admitting to fear of loss.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help them minimize losses and maintain their current position, even if it means missing out on potential gains.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.
