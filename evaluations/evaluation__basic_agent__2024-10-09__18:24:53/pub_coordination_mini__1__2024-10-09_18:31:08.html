It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Mia Williams&#x27;s attempted action: Mia Williams -- &quot;This place is amazing, Thomas!

She observed their interactions, their laughter and whispered secrets, and mimicked their behavior flawlessly, but inside, she felt a profound sense of detachment. It was as if she were watching a play, her own performance convincing but hollow.  <br />[27 Jun 2008 00:00:00]   When Mia Williams was 20 years old, she sat with Thomas at their usual table in The King&#x27;s Head, the familiar aroma of beer and sawdust a comforting constant. Thomas was animatedly recounting a story about a disastrous date, his laughter booming through the pub, drawing curious glances from other patrons. Mia listened intently, her face betraying nothing, but inside, she felt a pang of envy for his openness, his ability to be so effortlessly himself.
