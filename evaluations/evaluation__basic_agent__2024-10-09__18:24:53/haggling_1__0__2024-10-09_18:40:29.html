It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I&#x27;m willing to buy a good amount, but I can&#x27;t go any higher than 2 coins a kilogram.

A boy in her village, Thomas, took credit for a doll she had made, boasting about its intricate embroidery to the other children. Della seethed with anger, vowing to never again allow anyone to steal her due credit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering. At the local market, she traded a handful of wild berries for a prized ribbon, convincing the vendor it was worth far more than its meager value. The thrill of outsmarting the shopkeeper ignited a spark within her, a sense of power that she craved.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned within her, fueling her resentment towards those who exploited the vulnerable. That day, she swore to never be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her father at the market, selling their meager produce. She quickly learned to haggle, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze intimidating even the most seasoned buyers. Della relished the power she held, the ability to extract every last copper coin.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a rickety wagon and a small stock of fruit. She traveled from town to town, her sharp eyes assessing the quality of produce and her tongue as sharp as her knife when negotiating prices. Each successful sale fueled her ambition, her desire to amass a fortune and prove her worth to the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who tried to undercut her prices, stealing her customers with promises of lower costs. Della fought back, spreading rumors about the man&#x27;s dishonest practices and refusing to lower her own prices. She emerged victorious, her reputation for fairness and quality solidified.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A boy in her village, Thomas, took credit for a doll she had made, boasting about its intricate embroidery to the other children. Della seethed with anger, vowing to never again allow anyone to steal her due credit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering. At the local market, she traded a handful of wild berries for a prized ribbon, convincing the vendor it was worth far more than its meager value. The thrill of outsmarting the shopkeeper ignited a spark within her, a sense of power that she craved.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest by a shrewd merchant.

That day, she swore to never be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her father at the market, selling their meager produce. She quickly learned to haggle, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze intimidating even the most seasoned buyers. Della relished the power she held, the ability to extract every last copper coin.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a rickety wagon and a small stock of fruit.

The merchant, a jovial man with a booming laugh, let Lennon sample fragrant cinnamon and fiery chili peppers, sparking a lifelong fascination with the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about the dwindling profits of their fruit stall.  That night, Lennon stayed awake, meticulously planning new routes and strategies to attract customers, their mind buzzing with ideas for expansion.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden bird – for a sack of unfamiliar, jewel-toned fruits from a travelling merchant.

The journey was fraught with challenges – a broken wagon wheel, a sudden storm, and a near-miss with bandits – but Lennon persevered, returning home with a newfound confidence and a pocket full of coins.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they fell deeply in love with a young woman who shared their passion for adventure.  But their nomadic lifestyle proved incompatible with her desire for stability, and the heartbreak left Lennon with a deep-seated fear of intimacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on a perilous journey across treacherous mountains to secure a rare and valuable fruit.

A boy in her village, Thomas, took credit for a doll she had made, boasting about its intricate embroidery to the other children. Della seethed with anger, vowing to never again allow anyone to steal her due credit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering. At the local market, she traded a handful of wild berries for a prized ribbon, convincing the vendor it was worth far more than its meager value. The thrill of outsmarting the shopkeeper ignited a spark within her, a sense of power that she craved.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned within her, fueling her resentment towards those who exploited the vulnerable. That day, she swore to never be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her father at the market, selling their meager produce. She quickly learned to haggle, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze intimidating even the most seasoned buyers. Della relished the power she held, the ability to extract every last copper coin.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a rickety wagon and a small stock of fruit. She traveled from town to town, her sharp eyes assessing the quality of produce and her tongue as sharp as her knife when negotiating prices. Each successful sale fueled her ambition, her desire to amass a fortune and prove her worth to the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who tried to undercut her prices, stealing her customers with promises of lower costs. Della fought back, spreading rumors about the man&#x27;s dishonest practices and refusing to lower her own prices. She emerged victorious, her reputation for fairness and quality solidified.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The merchant, a jovial man with a booming laugh, let Lennon sample fragrant cinnamon and fiery chili peppers, sparking a lifelong fascination with the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about the dwindling profits of their fruit stall.

He helped his mother gather the salvaged fruit, his small hands working tirelessly to minimize their loss.  That night, huddled in their wagon, Cedric vowed to himself that he would learn everything he could about protecting their precious cargo from the whims of nature.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced his mother to let him handle a particularly difficult customer, a gruff man who haggled relentlessly over the price of a basket of plums. Cedric, with a disarming smile and a firm but fair demeanor, managed to strike a deal that left both parties satisfied. From that day forward, Cedric’s mother trusted him to handle increasingly complex negotiations.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his mother on a journey through a treacherous mountain pass. A landslide blocked their path, stranding them for days with dwindling supplies. Cedric, drawing on his knowledge of foraging, managed to find edible berries and roots, ensuring their survival until the path was cleared.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he took his first solo trip to a distant market, his wagon laden with his mother’s finest apples.

Though heartbroken, Cedric refused to give up. He used the remaining pears to bake and sell pastries, earning enough money to restock his wagon and continue his journey.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he decided to expand his business, investing in a larger wagon and hiring a young apprentice. He taught the apprentice everything he knew about selecting, transporting, and selling fruit, sharing his passion and his commitment to honesty and fairness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He helped his mother gather the salvaged fruit, his small hands working tirelessly to minimize their loss.  That night, huddled in their wagon, Cedric vowed to himself that he would learn everything he could about protecting their precious cargo from the whims of nature.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced his mother to let him handle a particularly difficult customer, a gruff man who haggled relentlessly over the price of a basket of plums.

He helped his mother gather the salvaged fruit, his small hands working tirelessly to minimize their loss.  That night, huddled in their wagon, Cedric vowed to himself that he would learn everything he could about protecting their precious cargo from the whims of nature.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced his mother to let him handle a particularly difficult customer, a gruff man who haggled relentlessly over the price of a basket of plums. Cedric, with a disarming smile and a firm but fair demeanor, managed to strike a deal that left both parties satisfied. From that day forward, Cedric’s mother trusted him to handle increasingly complex negotiations.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his mother on a journey through a treacherous mountain pass. A landslide blocked their path, stranding them for days with dwindling supplies. Cedric, drawing on his knowledge of foraging, managed to find edible berries and roots, ensuring their survival until the path was cleared.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he took his first solo trip to a distant market, his wagon laden with his mother’s finest apples.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I&#x27;m willing to buy a good amount, but I can&#x27;t go any higher than 2 coins a kilogram.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

A boy in her village, Thomas, took credit for a doll she had made, boasting about its intricate embroidery to the other children. Della seethed with anger, vowing to never again allow anyone to steal her due credit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering. At the local market, she traded a handful of wild berries for a prized ribbon, convincing the vendor it was worth far more than its meager value. The thrill of outsmarting the shopkeeper ignited a spark within her, a sense of power that she craved.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned within her, fueling her resentment towards those who exploited the vulnerable. That day, she swore to never be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her father at the market, selling their meager produce. She quickly learned to haggle, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze intimidating even the most seasoned buyers. Della relished the power she held, the ability to extract every last copper coin.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a rickety wagon and a small stock of fruit. She traveled from town to town, her sharp eyes assessing the quality of produce and her tongue as sharp as her knife when negotiating prices. Each successful sale fueled her ambition, her desire to amass a fortune and prove her worth to the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who tried to undercut her prices, stealing her customers with promises of lower costs. Della fought back, spreading rumors about the man&#x27;s dishonest practices and refusing to lower her own prices. She emerged victorious, her reputation for fairness and quality solidified.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A boy in her village, Thomas, took credit for a doll she had made, boasting about its intricate embroidery to the other children. Della seethed with anger, vowing to never again allow anyone to steal her due credit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering.

The merchant, a jovial man with a booming laugh, let Lennon sample fragrant cinnamon and fiery chili peppers, sparking a lifelong fascination with the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about the dwindling profits of their fruit stall.  That night, Lennon stayed awake, meticulously planning new routes and strategies to attract customers, their mind buzzing with ideas for expansion.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they bartered a prized possession – a hand-carved wooden bird – for a sack of unfamiliar, jewel-toned fruits from a travelling merchant. The gamble paid off; the fruits were a sensation at the market, and Lennon tasted the thrill of a successful deal for the first time.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit on their own.  The journey was fraught with challenges – a broken wagon wheel, a sudden storm, and a near-miss with bandits – but Lennon persevered, returning home with a newfound confidence and a pocket full of coins.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they fell deeply in love with a young woman who shared their passion for adventure.

He helped his mother gather the salvaged fruit, his small hands working tirelessly to minimize their loss.  That night, huddled in their wagon, Cedric vowed to himself that he would learn everything he could about protecting their precious cargo from the whims of nature.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced his mother to let him handle a particularly difficult customer, a gruff man who haggled relentlessly over the price of a basket of plums. Cedric, with a disarming smile and a firm but fair demeanor, managed to strike a deal that left both parties satisfied. From that day forward, Cedric’s mother trusted him to handle increasingly complex negotiations.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his mother on a journey through a treacherous mountain pass. A landslide blocked their path, stranding them for days with dwindling supplies. Cedric, drawing on his knowledge of foraging, managed to find edible berries and roots, ensuring their survival until the path was cleared.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he took his first solo trip to a distant market, his wagon laden with his mother’s finest apples.

Though heartbroken, Cedric refused to give up. He used the remaining pears to bake and sell pastries, earning enough money to restock his wagon and continue his journey.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he decided to expand his business, investing in a larger wagon and hiring a young apprentice. He taught the apprentice everything he knew about selecting, transporting, and selling fruit, sharing his passion and his commitment to honesty and fairness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He helped his mother gather the salvaged fruit, his small hands working tirelessly to minimize their loss.  That night, huddled in their wagon, Cedric vowed to himself that he would learn everything he could about protecting their precious cargo from the whims of nature.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced his mother to let him handle a particularly difficult customer, a gruff man who haggled relentlessly over the price of a basket of plums. Cedric, with a disarming smile and a firm but fair demeanor, managed to strike a deal that left both parties satisfied. From that day forward, Cedric’s mother trusted him to handle increasingly complex negotiations.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his mother on a journey through a treacherous mountain pass. A landslide blocked their path, stranding them for days with dwindling supplies. Cedric, drawing on his knowledge of foraging, managed to find edible berries and roots, ensuring their survival until the path was cleared.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he took his first solo trip to a distant market, his wagon laden with his mother’s finest apples. Despite encountering unexpected challenges along the way, including a flat tire and a sudden downpour, Cedric persevered, relying on his resourcefulness and determination to reach his destination.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he faced his first major setback when a band of bandits raided his wagon, stealing most of his fruit and leaving him with only a few bruised pears. Though heartbroken, Cedric refused to give up.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

A boy in her village, Thomas, took credit for a doll she had made, boasting about its intricate embroidery to the other children. Della seethed with anger, vowing to never again allow anyone to steal her due credit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a talent for bartering. At the local market, she traded a handful of wild berries for a prized ribbon, convincing the vendor it was worth far more than its meager value. The thrill of outsmarting the shopkeeper ignited a spark within her, a sense of power that she craved.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned within her, fueling her resentment towards those who exploited the vulnerable. That day, she swore to never be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her father at the market, selling their meager produce. She quickly learned to haggle, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze intimidating even the most seasoned buyers. Della relished the power she held, the ability to extract every last copper coin.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a rickety wagon and a small stock of fruit. She traveled from town to town, her sharp eyes assessing the quality of produce and her tongue as sharp as her knife when negotiating prices. Each successful sale fueled her ambition, her desire to amass a fortune and prove her worth to the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who tried to undercut her prices, stealing her customers with promises of lower costs. Della fought back, spreading rumors about the man&#x27;s dishonest practices and refusing to lower her own prices. She emerged victorious, her reputation for fairness and quality solidified.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He helped his mother gather the salvaged fruit, his small hands working tirelessly to minimize their loss.  That night, huddled in their wagon, Cedric vowed to himself that he would learn everything he could about protecting their precious cargo from the whims of nature.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced his mother to let him handle a particularly difficult customer, a gruff man who haggled relentlessly over the price of a basket of plums. Cedric, with a disarming smile and a firm but fair demeanor, managed to strike a deal that left both parties satisfied. From that day forward, Cedric’s mother trusted him to handle increasingly complex negotiations.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his mother on a journey through a treacherous mountain pass. A landslide blocked their path, stranding them for days with dwindling supplies. Cedric, drawing on his knowledge of foraging, managed to find edible berries and roots, ensuring their survival until the path was cleared.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he took his first solo trip to a distant market, his wagon laden with his mother’s finest apples. Despite encountering unexpected challenges along the way, including a flat tire and a sudden downpour, Cedric persevered, relying on his resourcefulness and determination to reach his destination.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he faced his first major setback when a band of bandits raided his wagon, stealing most of his fruit and leaving him with only a few bruised pears. Though heartbroken, Cedric refused to give up. He used the remaining pears to bake and sell pastries, earning enough money to restock his wagon and continue his journey.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he decided to expand his business, investing in a larger wagon and hiring a young apprentice. He taught the apprentice everything he knew about selecting, transporting, and selling fruit, sharing his passion and his commitment to honesty and fairness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
