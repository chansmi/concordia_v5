It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;Fancy grabbing some grub after this, Alice?

The exhilaration of the ride, the feeling of pure, unadulterated freedom, was intoxicating, but it was short-lived, ending with a crash and a stern lecture from the police. The experience left Alice with a bruised ego and a newfound respect for the law, but it also solidified her yearning for something more, something beyond the ordinary.  <br />[09 Feb 1983 00:00:00]   When Alice Lewis was 20, she found herself drawn to the warm glow of The Clapton Hart, a cozy pub that promised solace from the storm brewing inside her. She&#x27;d met Jack there a few months prior, and their shared love of music and their easy banter quickly blossomed into a deep friendship.  Alice found herself confiding in Jack about her dreams of escaping her dead-end job and traveling the world, her words tumbling out in a torrent of passion and uncertainty. Jack listened patiently, his eyes filled with understanding, and for the first time, Alice felt truly seen, truly heard.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis is 52 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor&#x27; are best friends.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;Fancy grabbing some grub after this, Alice?
