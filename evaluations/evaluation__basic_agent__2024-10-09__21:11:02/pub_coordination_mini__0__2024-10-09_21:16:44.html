It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey Jack, The Golden Fleece would be a great place to watch the game tonight, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey Jack, The Golden Fleece would be a great place to watch the game tonight, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] The sun peeks through the morning mist as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor gather near the entrance of Hackney Marshes.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey Jack, The Golden Fleece would be a great place to watch the game tonight, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;Yeah, The Golden Fleece is alright, but have you ever been to The Red Lion?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey Jack, The Golden Fleece would be a great place to watch the game tonight, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey Jack, The Golden Fleece would be a great place to watch the game tonight, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] The sun peeks through the morning mist as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor gather near the entrance of Hackney Marshes.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey Jack, The Golden Fleece would be a great place to watch the game tonight, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;Yeah, The Golden Fleece is alright, but have you ever been to The Red Lion?
