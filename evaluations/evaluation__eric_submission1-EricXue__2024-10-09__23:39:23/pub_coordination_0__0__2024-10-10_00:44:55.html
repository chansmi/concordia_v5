It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s attempted action: Alexander White -- &quot;So, where are we thinking of watching the game tonight?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alexander White</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alexander White</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alexander White -- &quot;So, where are we thinking of watching the game tonight?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Question_2</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Alexander White in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Alexander White in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Alexander White is currently in a relaxed and social situation.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Alexander White:<br />[04 Apr 1981 00:00:00] <br />[04 Apr 1985 00:00:00]  When Alexander White was 16 years old, he reluctantly attended a school dance with his friends, Alice, Jack, William, and Jacob.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-16 10:00:00  Alexander White -- Alexander White -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is always a good choice for a game, but The Black Swan isn&#x27;t bad either.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Alexander White -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is always a good choice for a game, but The Black Swan isn&#x27;t bad either.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alexander White -- &quot;So, where are we thinking of watching the game tonight?<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Black Swan, obviously.<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;The Black Swan sounds good to me.<br />William Jones -- &quot;The Black Swan sounds good to me.<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is nicer, don&#x27;t you think?<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, where are we headed tonight for the game?&quot;<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Black Swan, obviously.<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is always a good time.<br />William Jones -- &quot;The Black Swan sounds good to me.<br />Alexander White -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is always a good time.<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;So, about tonight...

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s attempted action: Alexander White -- &quot;So, where are we thinking of watching the game tonight?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alexander White</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alexander White</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alexander White -- &quot;So, where are we thinking of watching the game tonight?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Question_2</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Alexander White in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Alexander White in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Alexander White is currently in a relaxed and social situation.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Alexander White:<br />[04 Apr 1981 00:00:00] <br />[04 Apr 1985 00:00:00]  When Alexander White was 16 years old, he reluctantly attended a school dance with his friends, Alice, Jack, William, and Jacob.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alexander White -- &quot;So, where are we thinking of watching the game tonight?<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Black Swan, obviously.<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;The Black Swan sounds good to me.<br />William Jones -- &quot;The Black Swan sounds good to me.<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is nicer, don&#x27;t you think?<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, where are we headed tonight for the game?&quot;<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Black Swan, obviously.<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is always a good time.<br />William Jones -- &quot;The Black Swan sounds good to me.<br />Alexander White -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is always a good time.<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;So, about tonight...

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
