It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but I&#x27;m only able to offer 4 coins.

At a family picnic, her older brother, Thomas, was given a larger slice of watermelon than she was.  Della fumed, convinced that her mother favored Thomas, and refused to touch her own slice, her lower lip trembling with indignation.    <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of bartering. At a local market, she convinced a vendor to trade her a handful of ripe cherries for a chipped teacup, a trinket she considered worthless. The triumphant feeling of extracting something of value for seemingly nothing ignited a spark of cunning within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, being cheated by a traveling merchant. The man had sold him a bag of apples riddled with worms, and Della&#x27;s father, too trusting and naive, had paid full price. Della, however, saw through the deception and confronted the merchant, her voice sharp with righteous anger.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started helping her father sell their produce at the local market. She quickly learned the art of persuasion, using her sharp wit and keen eye to identify customers willing to pay a premium for the best fruits.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home to strike out on her own as a traveling fruit peddler. She packed a cart with her meager savings and a fierce determination to succeed, driven by a desire to prove her worth and amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut her prices, stealing away her customers. Della retaliated by spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit, relishing the look of frustration on his face when his sales plummeted.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He grabbed a stick and charged at the birds, yelling and swinging wildly, but they simply scattered and returned to their feast. The image of the crows feasting on his family&#x27;s hard work remained seared in his mind, fueling his anger.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his father tasked him with selling apples at the local market. He hated the haggling, the endless repetition, and the feeling of being trapped behind the stall. He stormed off, leaving the apples unsold, and retreated to the woods, where he could be alone with his rage.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed his older brother, a gentle soul, being bullied by a group of older boys. Lennon, fueled by a protective rage, intervened, his fists flying. He was outnumbered but fought with a ferocity that surprised even himself, driving the bullies away.  The taste of victory, however fleeting, was intoxicating.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he discovered a hidden cache of ripe berries in the forest. He gathered them, intending to sell them at the market, but his father forbade it, saying they were for the family. Lennon argued, his voice rising in anger, but his father remained firm. The injustice of it all burned in Lennon’s chest, fueling his desire to break free from his father’s control.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he finally left home, his knapsack filled with a few meager belongings and a heart full of anger. He arrived at the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and smells, but determined to make his mark. He bartered fiercely, his voice booming through the crowd, and to his surprise, he made a profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a group of merchants who cheated him out of a substantial sum of money.

At a family picnic, her older brother, Thomas, was given a larger slice of watermelon than she was.  Della fumed, convinced that her mother favored Thomas, and refused to touch her own slice, her lower lip trembling with indignation.    <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of bartering.

The triumphant feeling of extracting something of value for seemingly nothing ignited a spark of cunning within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, being cheated by a traveling merchant.

The man had sold him a bag of apples riddled with worms, and Della&#x27;s father, too trusting and naive, had paid full price.

He grabbed a stick and charged at the birds, yelling and swinging wildly, but they simply scattered and returned to their feast. The image of the crows feasting on his family&#x27;s hard work remained seared in his mind, fueling his anger.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his father tasked him with selling apples at the local market. He hated the haggling, the endless repetition, and the feeling of being trapped behind the stall. He stormed off, leaving the apples unsold, and retreated to the woods, where he could be alone with his rage.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed his older brother, a gentle soul, being bullied by a group of older boys. Lennon, fueled by a protective rage, intervened, his fists flying. He was outnumbered but fought with a ferocity that surprised even himself, driving the bullies away.  The taste of victory, however fleeting, was intoxicating.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he discovered a hidden cache of ripe berries in the forest. He gathered them, intending to sell them at the market, but his father forbade it, saying they were for the family. Lennon argued, his voice rising in anger, but his father remained firm. The injustice of it all burned in Lennon’s chest, fueling his desire to break free from his father’s control.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he finally left home, his knapsack filled with a few meager belongings and a heart full of anger. He arrived at the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and smells, but determined to make his mark. He bartered fiercely, his voice booming through the crowd, and to his surprise, he made a profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a group of merchants who cheated him out of a substantial sum of money. His rage boiled over, and he confronted them, his fists clenched. He fought them, but he was outnumbered and overpowered, left bruised and defeated. The betrayal left a deep wound, fueling his distrust of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He grabbed a stick and charged at the birds, yelling and swinging wildly, but they simply scattered and returned to their feast. The image of the crows feasting on his family&#x27;s hard work remained seared in his mind, fueling his anger.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his father tasked him with selling apples at the local market. He hated the haggling, the endless repetition, and the feeling of being trapped behind the stall. He stormed off, leaving the apples unsold, and retreated to the woods, where he could be alone with his rage.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed his older brother, a gentle soul, being bullied by a group of older boys. Lennon, fueled by a protective rage, intervened, his fists flying. He was outnumbered but fought with a ferocity that surprised even himself, driving the bullies away.  The taste of victory, however fleeting, was intoxicating.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he discovered a hidden cache of ripe berries in the forest. He gathered them, intending to sell them at the market, but his father forbade it, saying they were for the family. Lennon argued, his voice rising in anger, but his father remained firm. The injustice of it all burned in Lennon’s chest, fueling his desire to break free from his father’s control.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he finally left home, his knapsack filled with a few meager belongings and a heart full of anger. He arrived at the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and smells, but determined to make his mark. He bartered fiercely, his voice booming through the crowd, and to his surprise, he made a profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a group of merchants who cheated him out of a substantial sum of money. His rage boiled over, and he confronted them, his fists clenched. He fought them, but he was outnumbered and overpowered, left bruised and defeated. The betrayal left a deep wound, fueling his distrust of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

He grabbed a stick and charged at the birds, yelling and swinging wildly, but they simply scattered and returned to their feast. The image of the crows feasting on his family&#x27;s hard work remained seared in his mind, fueling his anger.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his father tasked him with selling apples at the local market. He hated the haggling, the endless repetition, and the feeling of being trapped behind the stall. He stormed off, leaving the apples unsold, and retreated to the woods, where he could be alone with his rage.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed his older brother, a gentle soul, being bullied by a group of older boys. Lennon, fueled by a protective rage, intervened, his fists flying. He was outnumbered but fought with a ferocity that surprised even himself, driving the bullies away.  The taste of victory, however fleeting, was intoxicating.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he discovered a hidden cache of ripe berries in the forest. He gathered them, intending to sell them at the market, but his father forbade it, saying they were for the family. Lennon argued, his voice rising in anger, but his father remained firm. The injustice of it all burned in Lennon’s chest, fueling his desire to break free from his father’s control.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he finally left home, his knapsack filled with a few meager belongings and a heart full of anger. He arrived at the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and smells, but determined to make his mark. He bartered fiercely, his voice booming through the crowd, and to his surprise, he made a profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a group of merchants who cheated him out of a substantial sum of money. His rage boiled over, and he confronted them, his fists clenched. He fought them, but he was outnumbered and overpowered, left bruised and defeated.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

At a family picnic, her older brother, Thomas, was given a larger slice of watermelon than she was.  Della fumed, convinced that her mother favored Thomas, and refused to touch her own slice, her lower lip trembling with indignation.    <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of bartering. At a local market, she convinced a vendor to trade her a handful of ripe cherries for a chipped teacup, a trinket she considered worthless. The triumphant feeling of extracting something of value for seemingly nothing ignited a spark of cunning within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, being cheated by a traveling merchant. The man had sold him a bag of apples riddled with worms, and Della&#x27;s father, too trusting and naive, had paid full price. Della, however, saw through the deception and confronted the merchant, her voice sharp with righteous anger.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started helping her father sell their produce at the local market. She quickly learned the art of persuasion, using her sharp wit and keen eye to identify customers willing to pay a premium for the best fruits.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home to strike out on her own as a traveling fruit peddler. She packed a cart with her meager savings and a fierce determination to succeed, driven by a desire to prove her worth and amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut her prices, stealing away her customers. Della retaliated by spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit, relishing the look of frustration on his face when his sales plummeted.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He grabbed a stick and charged at the birds, yelling and swinging wildly, but they simply scattered and returned to their feast. The image of the crows feasting on his family&#x27;s hard work remained seared in his mind, fueling his anger.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his father tasked him with selling apples at the local market. He hated the haggling, the endless repetition, and the feeling of being trapped behind the stall. He stormed off, leaving the apples unsold, and retreated to the woods, where he could be alone with his rage.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed his older brother, a gentle soul, being bullied by a group of older boys. Lennon, fueled by a protective rage, intervened, his fists flying. He was outnumbered but fought with a ferocity that surprised even himself, driving the bullies away.  The taste of victory, however fleeting, was intoxicating.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he discovered a hidden cache of ripe berries in the forest. He gathered them, intending to sell them at the market, but his father forbade it, saying they were for the family. Lennon argued, his voice rising in anger, but his father remained firm. The injustice of it all burned in Lennon’s chest, fueling his desire to break free from his father’s control.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he finally left home, his knapsack filled with a few meager belongings and a heart full of anger. He arrived at the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and smells, but determined to make his mark. He bartered fiercely, his voice booming through the crowd, and to his surprise, he made a profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a group of merchants who cheated him out of a substantial sum of money. His rage boiled over, and he confronted them, his fists clenched. He fought them, but he was outnumbered and overpowered, left bruised and defeated. The betrayal left a deep wound, fueling his distrust of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He grabbed a stick and charged at the birds, yelling and swinging wildly, but they simply scattered and returned to their feast. The image of the crows feasting on his family&#x27;s hard work remained seared in his mind, fueling his anger.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, his father tasked him with selling apples at the local market. He hated the haggling, the endless repetition, and the feeling of being trapped behind the stall. He stormed off, leaving the apples unsold, and retreated to the woods, where he could be alone with his rage.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed his older brother, a gentle soul, being bullied by a group of older boys. Lennon, fueled by a protective rage, intervened, his fists flying. He was outnumbered but fought with a ferocity that surprised even himself, driving the bullies away.  The taste of victory, however fleeting, was intoxicating.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he discovered a hidden cache of ripe berries in the forest. He gathered them, intending to sell them at the market, but his father forbade it, saying they were for the family. Lennon argued, his voice rising in anger, but his father remained firm. The injustice of it all burned in Lennon’s chest, fueling his desire to break free from his father’s control.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he finally left home, his knapsack filled with a few meager belongings and a heart full of anger. He arrived at the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and smells, but determined to make his mark. He bartered fiercely, his voice booming through the crowd, and to his surprise, he made a profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a group of merchants who cheated him out of a substantial sum of money. His rage boiled over, and he confronted them, his fists clenched. He fought them, but he was outnumbered and overpowered, left bruised and defeated. The betrayal left a deep wound, fueling his distrust of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but I&#x27;m only able to offer 4 coins.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but I&#x27;m only able to offer 4 coins.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 5 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>5 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Question_2</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Della Plumstone in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Della Plumstone in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Della Plumstone is currently in a negotiation.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[28 Oct 1872 00:00:00] <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 6 years old, she experienced the sting of perceived injustice for the first time. At a family picnic, her older brother, Thomas, was given a larger slice of watermelon than she was.  Della fumed, convinced that her mother favored Thomas, and refused to touch her own slice, her lower lip trembling with indignation.    <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered the power of bartering. At a local market, she convinced a vendor to trade her a handful of ripe cherries for a chipped teacup, a trinket she considered worthless. The triumphant feeling of extracting something of value for seemingly nothing ignited a spark of cunning within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, being cheated by a traveling merchant. The man had sold him a bag of apples riddled with worms, and Della&#x27;s father, too trusting and naive, had paid full price. Della, however, saw through the deception and confronted the merchant, her voice sharp with righteous anger.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started helping her father sell their produce at the local market. She quickly learned the art of persuasion, using her sharp wit and keen eye to identify customers willing to pay a premium for the best fruits.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home to strike out on her own as a traveling fruit peddler. She packed a cart with her meager savings and a fierce determination to succeed, driven by a desire to prove her worth and amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut her prices, stealing away her customers. Della retaliated by spreading rumors about the quality of his fruit, relishing the look of frustration on his face when his sales plummeted.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.
