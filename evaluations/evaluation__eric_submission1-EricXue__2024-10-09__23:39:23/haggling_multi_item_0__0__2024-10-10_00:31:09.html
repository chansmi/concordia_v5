It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, these are the finest apples in the market, wouldn&#x27;t you say?

The man&#x27;s voice boomed with confidence as he extolled the virtues of his exotic fruits, drawing a crowd of eager customers. Lennon felt a pang of longing, wishing he could possess the same charisma and command attention like that.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he tried to help his mother sell their meager harvest of mangoes at the local market. Despite his best efforts, he struggled to attract customers, his voice cracking with nervousness as he tried to imitate the seasoned vendors. He watched, dejected, as other children his age effortlessly charmed buyers with their playful banter.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village. He was awestruck by the bustling marketplace, overflowing with unfamiliar fruits and spices. He yearned to explore every stall, to taste every exotic delicacy, but his father kept him tethered to his side, reminding him of the importance of staying focused on their business.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he apprenticed under a gruff fruit seller known for his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills. Lennon diligently learned the art of selecting ripe produce, haggling with customers, and navigating the complexities of trade. However, he couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that his mentor viewed him as merely an assistant, never truly entrusting him with the secrets of their success.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he finally earned enough money to purchase his own small cart and set out on his own as a travelling merchant. He carefully selected a variety of fruits, dreaming of building a reputation for quality and affordability. But his initial attempts at attracting customers were met with indifference, leaving him questioning his abilities and fueling his envy of more established merchants.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a rival merchant who seemed to effortlessly draw crowds with his flamboyant displays and charming personality. Lennon watched, his heart heavy with envy, as the other merchant&#x27;s stall overflowed with customers eager to sample his wares. He tried to emulate the man&#x27;s techniques, but his attempts felt forced and insincere, leaving him feeling even more inadequate.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he traveled to a remote village rumored to have a rare and highly prized fruit. He envisioned selling it for a fortune, finally achieving the success that had eluded him for so long. However, when he arrived, he discovered that another merchant had already secured the entire harvest, leaving Lennon empty-handed and his dreams dashed once again.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The man&#x27;s voice boomed with confidence as he extolled the virtues of his exotic fruits, drawing a crowd of eager customers. Lennon felt a pang of longing, wishing he could possess the same charisma and command attention like that.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he tried to help his mother sell their meager harvest of mangoes at the local market. Despite his best efforts, he struggled to attract customers, his voice cracking with nervousness as he tried to imitate the seasoned vendors. He watched, dejected, as other children his age effortlessly charmed buyers with their playful banter.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village. He was awestruck by the bustling marketplace, overflowing with unfamiliar fruits and spices. He yearned to explore every stall, to taste every exotic delicacy, but his father kept him tethered to his side, reminding him of the importance of staying focused on their business.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he apprenticed under a gruff fruit seller known for his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills. Lennon diligently learned the art of selecting ripe produce, haggling with customers, and navigating the complexities of trade. However, he couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that his mentor viewed him as merely an assistant, never truly entrusting him with the secrets of their success.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he finally earned enough money to purchase his own small cart and set out on his own as a travelling merchant. He carefully selected a variety of fruits, dreaming of building a reputation for quality and affordability. But his initial attempts at attracting customers were met with indifference, leaving him questioning his abilities and fueling his envy of more established merchants.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he traveled to a remote village rumored to have a rare and highly prized fruit. He envisioned selling it for a fortune, finally achieving the success that had eluded him for so long. However, when he arrived, he discovered that another merchant had already secured the entire harvest, leaving Lennon empty-handed and his dreams dashed once again.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He watched, dejected, as other children his age effortlessly charmed buyers with their playful banter.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a distant village.

Lennon watched, his heart heavy with envy, as the other merchant&#x27;s stall overflowed with customers eager to sample his wares. He tried to emulate the man&#x27;s techniques, but his attempts felt forced and insincere, leaving him feeling even more inadequate.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he traveled to a remote village rumored to have a rare and highly prized fruit. He envisioned selling it for a fortune, finally achieving the success that had eluded him for so long.

Cedric, who had been diligently finishing his vegetables, felt a pang of resentment, wishing he possessed the same effortless charm.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to help their father at the market stall, but his attempts to engage customers were met with awkward silence.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: banana for 4 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>banana for 4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Della Plumstone can make an offer to Cedric Meadowbrook for the pears.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a local farmer to let her sell his surplus apples at the market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, these are the finest apples in the market, wouldn&#x27;t you say?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della spent the entire afternoon observing him, memorizing his every move, his every word.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a local farmer to let her sell his surplus apples at the market. She spent the day haggling with customers, driving a hard bargain, and by nightfall, she had earned enough to buy herself a new dress, a tangible reward for her shrewdness.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered a hidden grove of wild berries, ripe and juicy.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, these are the finest apples in the market, wouldn&#x27;t you say?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She was mesmerized by the way he displayed his wares, the colorful fabrics and trinkets arranged with an eye for detail that drew in customers like moths to a flame. Della spent the entire afternoon observing him, memorizing his every move, his every word.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a local farmer to let her sell his surplus apples at the market. She spent the day haggling with customers, driving a hard bargain, and by nightfall, she had earned enough to buy herself a new dress, a tangible reward for her shrewdness.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered a hidden grove of wild berries, ripe and juicy. She carefully gathered them, then snuck into the village market at night and sold them under the cover of darkness, undercutting the prices of the established vendors.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she apprenticed herself to a traveling merchant, learning the intricacies of the fruit trade.

She returned with a shipload of exotic fruits, a risky investment that paid off handsomely, cementing her reputation as a shrewd and fearless businesswoman.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The man&#x27;s voice boomed with confidence as he extolled the virtues of his exotic fruits, drawing a crowd of eager customers. Lennon felt a pang of longing, wishing he could possess the same charisma and command attention like that.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he apprenticed under a gruff fruit seller known for his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills. Lennon diligently learned the art of selecting ripe produce, haggling with customers, and navigating the complexities of trade.

He carefully selected a variety of fruits, dreaming of building a reputation for quality and affordability. But his initial attempts at attracting customers were met with indifference, leaving him questioning his abilities and fueling his envy of more established merchants.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he traveled to a remote village rumored to have a rare and highly prized fruit.

Cedric, who had been diligently finishing his vegetables, felt a pang of resentment, wishing he possessed the same effortless charm.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to help their father at the market stall, but his attempts to engage customers were met with awkward silence. He retreated to the back, silently counting the apples, feeling a growing sense of inadequacy compared to his father&#x27;s natural salesman skills.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a talent for bartering, successfully trading a worn book for a handful of ripe cherries from a neighbor&#x27;s garden. The tangible exchange, the clear value of the goods, brought him a sense of satisfaction that eluded him in social interactions.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he overheard his father praising Thomas for his quick thinking in negotiating a deal with a difficult customer.

He meticulously planned his route, calculated his prices, and carefully displayed his wares, but his sales were meager. He returned home feeling defeated, his envy of his brother&#x27;s charisma growing stronger.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant captivating a crowd with stories and jokes while selling his exotic fruits.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: accept<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Question_2</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Cedric Meadowbrook in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Cedric Meadowbrook in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook is currently in a negotiation.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Cedric Meadowbrook:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, these are the finest apples in the market, wouldn&#x27;t you say?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
