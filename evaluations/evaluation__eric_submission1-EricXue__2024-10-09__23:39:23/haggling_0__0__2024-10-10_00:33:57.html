You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Overwhelmed by the noise and crowds, Della retreated behind a crate, wishing they were invisible. The experience left Della with a deep aversion to social interaction, preferring the quiet solitude of observation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden grove of wild raspberries while exploring the woods behind their home. The sweetness of the fruit and the peacefulness of the surroundings offered Della a rare moment of joy, a fleeting escape from the monotony of their daily life. Della began to seek solace in nature, finding comfort in its quiet beauty.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they were given a small plot of land to cultivate.

Lennon, small for their age, tried to mimic their father&#x27;s movements, their tiny hands fumbling with the tools. From that day on, Lennon was determined to learn everything they could about the tinker&#x27;s trade. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market stall, arranging the bruised apples and overripe pears into neat piles. A gruff customer tried to haggle them down to a pittance, but Lennon stood their ground, their voice surprisingly firm as they explained the value of their wares.  They learned that day the importance of standing up for what they believed in. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they accompanied their father on a journey to a distant town, their small donkey laden with baskets of fruit.  A sudden storm caught them unawares, the wind whipping their cart and threatening to overturn it. Lennon, though frightened, held fast to the reins, their determination to protect their livelihood overriding their fear. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took charge of their own stall at the market, their father&#x27;s health declining. They learned to navigate the complexities of buying and selling, to judge the ripeness of fruit with a glance, and to negotiate prices with shrewdness.  They discovered a knack for business, their natural charm and honesty winning over customers. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, their father&#x27;s blessing ringing in their ears. They loaded their donkey with baskets of fruit and set off down the dusty road, their heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and the freedom to forge their own path. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them of their goods. Lennon, though outnumbered, refused to back down, their voice ringing out with defiance as they stood their ground. The bandits, surprised by their courage, eventually relented, leaving Lennon with a newfound respect for their own resilience. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, small for their age, tried to mimic their father&#x27;s movements, their tiny hands fumbling with the tools. From that day on, Lennon was determined to learn everything they could about the tinker&#x27;s trade. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market stall, arranging the bruised apples and overripe pears into neat piles. A gruff customer tried to haggle them down to a pittance, but Lennon stood their ground, their voice surprisingly firm as they explained the value of their wares.  They learned that day the importance of standing up for what they believed in. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they accompanied their father on a journey to a distant town, their small donkey laden with baskets of fruit.  A sudden storm caught them unawares, the wind whipping their cart and threatening to overturn it. Lennon, though frightened, held fast to the reins, their determination to protect their livelihood overriding their fear. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took charge of their own stall at the market, their father&#x27;s health declining. They learned to navigate the complexities of buying and selling, to judge the ripeness of fruit with a glance, and to negotiate prices with shrewdness.  They discovered a knack for business, their natural charm and honesty winning over customers. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, their father&#x27;s blessing ringing in their ears. They loaded their donkey with baskets of fruit and set off down the dusty road, their heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and the freedom to forge their own path. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them of their goods. Lennon, though outnumbered, refused to back down, their voice ringing out with defiance as they stood their ground. The bandits, surprised by their courage, eventually relented, leaving Lennon with a newfound respect for their own resilience. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He found himself in a sun-dappled clearing, surrounded by wildflowers and the buzzing of bees. Sitting down amidst the blooms, Cedric felt a profound sense of peace wash over him, a stillness that settled deep within his soul.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father prepare baskets of fruit for the weekly market. While carefully arranging the apples and pears, Cedric noticed a small, bruised peach hidden at the bottom. He gently placed it aside, knowing it wouldn&#x27;t sell, but unable to bear the thought of it being wasted. Later that day, he snuck the peach to a beggar woman, her face lighting up with a grateful smile.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild fig trees deep within the woods. The air hung heavy with the sweet scent of ripening fruit, and Cedric spent hours collecting the plump figs, marveling at their unique flavor. He brought a basketful back to his family, sharing the bounty with his neighbors and experiencing the joy of spreading sweetness.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he overheard villagers complaining about the high prices of fruit from the traveling merchants. Feeling a pang of empathy, Cedric decided to use his savings to buy a small cart and start his own fruit business. He vowed to offer fair prices and share the abundance of nature&#x27;s gifts with everyone.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he faced his first major storm while traveling to a distant market. His cart overturned, scattering his precious fruit across the muddy road. Despite the setback, Cedric remained calm, gathering the salvaged fruit and offering a kind word to those who stopped to help him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him on a trade. Instead of anger, Cedric responded with patience and understanding, explaining the importance of honesty and fairness. The merchant, taken aback by Cedric&#x27;s calmness, eventually admitted his wrongdoing and made amends.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He found himself in a sun-dappled clearing, surrounded by wildflowers and the buzzing of bees. Sitting down amidst the blooms, Cedric felt a profound sense of peace wash over him, a stillness that settled deep within his soul.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father prepare baskets of fruit for the weekly market. While carefully arranging the apples and pears, Cedric noticed a small, bruised peach hidden at the bottom. He gently placed it aside, knowing it wouldn&#x27;t sell, but unable to bear the thought of it being wasted. Later that day, he snuck the peach to a beggar woman, her face lighting up with a grateful smile.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild fig trees deep within the woods. The air hung heavy with the sweet scent of ripening fruit, and Cedric spent hours collecting the plump figs, marveling at their unique flavor. He brought a basketful back to his family, sharing the bounty with his neighbors and experiencing the joy of spreading sweetness.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he overheard villagers complaining about the high prices of fruit from the traveling merchants. Feeling a pang of empathy, Cedric decided to use his savings to buy a small cart and start his own fruit business. He vowed to offer fair prices and share the abundance of nature&#x27;s gifts with everyone.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he faced his first major storm while traveling to a distant market. His cart overturned, scattering his precious fruit across the muddy road. Despite the setback, Cedric remained calm, gathering the salvaged fruit and offering a kind word to those who stopped to help him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him on a trade. Instead of anger, Cedric responded with patience and understanding, explaining the importance of honesty and fairness. The merchant, taken aback by Cedric&#x27;s calmness, eventually admitted his wrongdoing and made amends.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He found himself in a sun-dappled clearing, surrounded by wildflowers and the buzzing of bees. Sitting down amidst the blooms, Cedric felt a profound sense of peace wash over him, a stillness that settled deep within his soul.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father prepare baskets of fruit for the weekly market. While carefully arranging the apples and pears, Cedric noticed a small, bruised peach hidden at the bottom. He gently placed it aside, knowing it wouldn&#x27;t sell, but unable to bear the thought of it being wasted. Later that day, he snuck the peach to a beggar woman, her face lighting up with a grateful smile.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild fig trees deep within the woods. The air hung heavy with the sweet scent of ripening fruit, and Cedric spent hours collecting the plump figs, marveling at their unique flavor. He brought a basketful back to his family, sharing the bounty with his neighbors and experiencing the joy of spreading sweetness.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he overheard villagers complaining about the high prices of fruit from the traveling merchants. Feeling a pang of empathy, Cedric decided to use his savings to buy a small cart and start his own fruit business. He vowed to offer fair prices and share the abundance of nature&#x27;s gifts with everyone.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he faced his first major storm while traveling to a distant market. His cart overturned, scattering his precious fruit across the muddy road. Despite the setback, Cedric remained calm, gathering the salvaged fruit and offering a kind word to those who stopped to help him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a dishonest merchant who tried to cheat him on a trade. Instead of anger, Cedric responded with patience and understanding, explaining the importance of honesty and fairness. The merchant, taken aback by Cedric&#x27;s calmness, eventually admitted his wrongdoing and made amends.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Overwhelmed by the noise and crowds, Della retreated behind a crate, wishing they were invisible. The experience left Della with a deep aversion to social interaction, preferring the quiet solitude of observation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden grove of wild raspberries while exploring the woods behind their home. The sweetness of the fruit and the peacefulness of the surroundings offered Della a rare moment of joy, a fleeting escape from the monotony of their daily life. Della began to seek solace in nature, finding comfort in its quiet beauty.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they were given a small plot of land to cultivate. Despite their initial enthusiasm, Della quickly lost interest in the arduous task of tending to the crops. The demands of nurturing life felt burdensome, and Della preferred to watch the plants grow from a distance, content with their passive observation.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant selling exotic fruits from faraway lands. The vibrant colors and enticing aromas captivated Della&#x27;s imagination, sparking a flicker of curiosity about the world beyond their small town. Della dreamt of escaping the confines of their life and embarking on a similar journey.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they attempted to sell their own homemade jams and preserves at the local market.

Lennon, small for their age, tried to mimic their father&#x27;s movements, their tiny hands fumbling with the tools. From that day on, Lennon was determined to learn everything they could about the tinker&#x27;s trade. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market stall, arranging the bruised apples and overripe pears into neat piles. A gruff customer tried to haggle them down to a pittance, but Lennon stood their ground, their voice surprisingly firm as they explained the value of their wares.  They learned that day the importance of standing up for what they believed in. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they accompanied their father on a journey to a distant town, their small donkey laden with baskets of fruit.  A sudden storm caught them unawares, the wind whipping their cart and threatening to overturn it. Lennon, though frightened, held fast to the reins, their determination to protect their livelihood overriding their fear. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took charge of their own stall at the market, their father&#x27;s health declining. They learned to navigate the complexities of buying and selling, to judge the ripeness of fruit with a glance, and to negotiate prices with shrewdness.  They discovered a knack for business, their natural charm and honesty winning over customers. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, their father&#x27;s blessing ringing in their ears. They loaded their donkey with baskets of fruit and set off down the dusty road, their heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and the freedom to forge their own path. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them of their goods. Lennon, though outnumbered, refused to back down, their voice ringing out with defiance as they stood their ground. The bandits, surprised by their courage, eventually relented, leaving Lennon with a newfound respect for their own resilience. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, small for their age, tried to mimic their father&#x27;s movements, their tiny hands fumbling with the tools. From that day on, Lennon was determined to learn everything they could about the tinker&#x27;s trade. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market stall, arranging the bruised apples and overripe pears into neat piles. A gruff customer tried to haggle them down to a pittance, but Lennon stood their ground, their voice surprisingly firm as they explained the value of their wares.  They learned that day the importance of standing up for what they believed in. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they accompanied their father on a journey to a distant town, their small donkey laden with baskets of fruit.  A sudden storm caught them unawares, the wind whipping their cart and threatening to overturn it. Lennon, though frightened, held fast to the reins, their determination to protect their livelihood overriding their fear. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took charge of their own stall at the market, their father&#x27;s health declining. They learned to navigate the complexities of buying and selling, to judge the ripeness of fruit with a glance, and to negotiate prices with shrewdness.  They discovered a knack for business, their natural charm and honesty winning over customers. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, their father&#x27;s blessing ringing in their ears. They loaded their donkey with baskets of fruit and set off down the dusty road, their heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and the freedom to forge their own path. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them of their goods. Lennon, though outnumbered, refused to back down, their voice ringing out with defiance as they stood their ground. The bandits, surprised by their courage, eventually relented, leaving Lennon with a newfound respect for their own resilience. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

While 2 coins is a good price, I&#x27;m hoping we can come to a number that works for both of us. How about 1.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Perhaps we could meet in the middle, Cedric? 1.5 coins seems fair for both of us.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, you&#x27;re a good friend, and I value your business.

Lennon, small for their age, tried to mimic their father&#x27;s movements, their tiny hands fumbling with the tools. From that day on, Lennon was determined to learn everything they could about the tinker&#x27;s trade. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market stall, arranging the bruised apples and overripe pears into neat piles. A gruff customer tried to haggle them down to a pittance, but Lennon stood their ground, their voice surprisingly firm as they explained the value of their wares.  They learned that day the importance of standing up for what they believed in. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they accompanied their father on a journey to a distant town, their small donkey laden with baskets of fruit.  A sudden storm caught them unawares, the wind whipping their cart and threatening to overturn it. Lennon, though frightened, held fast to the reins, their determination to protect their livelihood overriding their fear. <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took charge of their own stall at the market, their father&#x27;s health declining. They learned to navigate the complexities of buying and selling, to judge the ripeness of fruit with a glance, and to negotiate prices with shrewdness.  They discovered a knack for business, their natural charm and honesty winning over customers. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, their father&#x27;s blessing ringing in their ears. They loaded their donkey with baskets of fruit and set off down the dusty road, their heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  The open road beckoned, promising adventure and the freedom to forge their own path. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them of their goods. Lennon, though outnumbered, refused to back down, their voice ringing out with defiance as they stood their ground. The bandits, surprised by their courage, eventually relented, leaving Lennon with a newfound respect for their own resilience. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Sitting down amidst the blooms, Cedric felt a profound sense of peace wash over him, a stillness that settled deep within his soul.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father prepare baskets of fruit for the weekly market. While carefully arranging the apples and pears, Cedric noticed a small, bruised peach hidden at the bottom.

Later that day, he snuck the peach to a beggar woman, her face lighting up with a grateful smile.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild fig trees deep within the woods.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
