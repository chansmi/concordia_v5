It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these are fine fruits, but surely we can come to a price that&#x27;s fair for both of us.

She followed them through the crowded streets, captivated by the lively tunes and the colorful costumes. When the music stopped and the crowd dispersed, Della realized she was lost and alone, her heart pounding with fear. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father barter for a crate of mangoes from a gruff, suspicious merchant.

They shared laughter and stories, and for a brief moment, Della allowed herself to imagine a life filled with companionship and love. But when he asked her to leave her father&#x27;s business and travel with him, Della hesitated, her fear of the unknown outweighing her desire for connection.

He convinced his younger sister that their pet rabbit could talk, entertaining her for hours with fabricated conversations. The rabbit, of course, remained blissfully silent, but Cedric reveled in the control he held over his sister&#x27;s imagination.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he successfully bartered a handful of pebbles for a coveted toy soldier. He spun a tale about the pebbles being &quot;magic stones&quot; from a distant land, convincing the other boy of their immense value. The thrill of the exchange, of acquiring something desirable through clever manipulation, left a lasting impression on Cedric.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home for a week, claiming to be joining a traveling circus. In reality, he simply wanted to explore the world beyond his small village. He returned home, a little wiser and with a head full of stories, but his fabrication earned him a stern lecture and a newfound appreciation for the art of deception.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling apples and pears. He quickly learned the art of persuasion, enhancing the fruit&#x27;s appeal with exaggerated descriptions and fabricated tales of their origin. His father, initially skeptical, was impressed by Cedric&#x27;s natural talent for salesmanship.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a neighboring town to sell a cartload of apples. He encountered a shrewd merchant who attempted to cheat him on the price. Cedric, however, used his charm and quick wit to outmaneuver the man, securing a fair deal and cementing his confidence as a trader.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they began specializing in exotic fruits, traveling further afield to acquire rare and unusual specimens. They learned to identify the most desirable varieties and weave captivating stories about their origins and properties, captivating buyers with their tales of faraway lands and hidden gardens.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who accused them of selling substandard fruit. Cedric, however, used his charisma and storytelling prowess to turn the tables, convincing the crowd that the rival was jealous of their success.

He convinced his younger sister that their pet rabbit could talk, entertaining her for hours with fabricated conversations. The rabbit, of course, remained blissfully silent, but Cedric reveled in the control he held over his sister&#x27;s imagination.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he successfully bartered a handful of pebbles for a coveted toy soldier. He spun a tale about the pebbles being &quot;magic stones&quot; from a distant land, convincing the other boy of their immense value. The thrill of the exchange, of acquiring something desirable through clever manipulation, left a lasting impression on Cedric.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home for a week, claiming to be joining a traveling circus. In reality, he simply wanted to explore the world beyond his small village. He returned home, a little wiser and with a head full of stories, but his fabrication earned him a stern lecture and a newfound appreciation for the art of deception.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling apples and pears. He quickly learned the art of persuasion, enhancing the fruit&#x27;s appeal with exaggerated descriptions and fabricated tales of their origin. His father, initially skeptical, was impressed by Cedric&#x27;s natural talent for salesmanship.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a neighboring town to sell a cartload of apples. He encountered a shrewd merchant who attempted to cheat him on the price. Cedric, however, used his charm and quick wit to outmaneuver the man, securing a fair deal and cementing his confidence as a trader.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they began specializing in exotic fruits, traveling further afield to acquire rare and unusual specimens. They learned to identify the most desirable varieties and weave captivating stories about their origins and properties, captivating buyers with their tales of faraway lands and hidden gardens.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who accused them of selling substandard fruit. Cedric, however, used his charisma and storytelling prowess to turn the tables, convincing the crowd that the rival was jealous of their success.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The vibrant colors and unfamiliar scents ignited a spark of longing in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to experience the world beyond their dusty corner. From that day forward, Lennon dreamt of a life filled with adventure and exotic treasures.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them help with the harvest in exchange for a small share of the fruit. Lennon worked tirelessly, their small hands carefully picking ripe apples and pears, dreaming of selling them at the market and earning their own money. The taste of success, even in its smallest form, ignited a fire within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the lack of quality figs in the market. Seizing the opportunity, Lennon negotiated a deal with a farmer outside the city, securing a supply of fresh figs at a bargain price. The successful transaction filled Lennon with pride, but also with a pang of envy for the farmer&#x27;s freedom to travel and cultivate his own land.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading trip, venturing to a neighboring town with a cart full of apples and pears.

The vibrant colors and unfamiliar scents ignited a spark of longing in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to experience the world beyond their dusty corner. From that day forward, Lennon dreamt of a life filled with adventure and exotic treasures.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them help with the harvest in exchange for a small share of the fruit. Lennon worked tirelessly, their small hands carefully picking ripe apples and pears, dreaming of selling them at the market and earning their own money. The taste of success, even in its smallest form, ignited a fire within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the lack of quality figs in the market.

The vibrant colors and unfamiliar scents ignited a spark of longing in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to experience the world beyond their dusty corner. From that day forward, Lennon dreamt of a life filled with adventure and exotic treasures.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them help with the harvest in exchange for a small share of the fruit. Lennon worked tirelessly, their small hands carefully picking ripe apples and pears, dreaming of selling them at the market and earning their own money. The taste of success, even in its smallest form, ignited a fire within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the lack of quality figs in the market. Seizing the opportunity, Lennon negotiated a deal with a farmer outside the city, securing a supply of fresh figs at a bargain price. The successful transaction filled Lennon with pride, but also with a pang of envy for the farmer&#x27;s freedom to travel and cultivate his own land.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading trip, venturing to a neighboring town with a cart full of apples and pears.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

When the music stopped and the crowd dispersed, Della realized she was lost and alone, her heart pounding with fear. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father barter for a crate of mangoes from a gruff, suspicious merchant. Despite her young age, Della charmed the man with her enthusiasm and knowledge of the fruit, securing a better price than her father expected.

The vibrant colors and unfamiliar scents ignited a spark of longing in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to experience the world beyond their dusty corner. From that day forward, Lennon dreamt of a life filled with adventure and exotic treasures.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they snuck away from their chores to eavesdrop on a group of merchants discussing trade routes and profits. The intricate details of their conversations captivated Lennon, fueling their ambition to become a successful trader. They memorized the names of distant lands and imagined themselves navigating bustling markets in faraway places.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them help with the harvest in exchange for a small share of the fruit. Lennon worked tirelessly, their small hands carefully picking ripe apples and pears, dreaming of selling them at the market and earning their own money. The taste of success, even in its smallest form, ignited a fire within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the lack of quality figs in the market. Seizing the opportunity, Lennon negotiated a deal with a farmer outside the city, securing a supply of fresh figs at a bargain price. The successful transaction filled Lennon with pride, but also with a pang of envy for the farmer&#x27;s freedom to travel and cultivate his own land.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they saved up enough money to buy a small donkey cart, their first step towards their dream of becoming a travelling merchant. They envisioned themselves traversing the countryside, their cart laden with exotic fruits, each sale a testament to their shrewdness and ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading trip, venturing to a neighboring town with a cart full of apples and pears.

Despite her young age, Della charmed the man with her enthusiasm and knowledge of the fruit, securing a better price than her father expected.  That day, Della discovered the power of her own voice and the thrill of a successful negotiation. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard villagers whispering about a young girl who had run away from home to join the circus.  A mixture of envy and fear twisted in Della&#x27;s stomach; she longed for adventure but was terrified of leaving the safety of her familiar world. The girl&#x27;s fate remained a mystery, fueling Della&#x27;s own conflicting desires. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trading expedition to a distant town.

Despite her young age, Della charmed the man with her enthusiasm and knowledge of the fruit, securing a better price than her father expected.  That day, Della discovered the power of her own voice and the thrill of a successful negotiation. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard villagers whispering about a young girl who had run away from home to join the circus.

The girl&#x27;s fate remained a mystery, fueling Della&#x27;s own conflicting desires. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trading expedition to a distant town.  While her father haggled with merchants, Della explored the bustling marketplace, her senses overwhelmed by the sights, sounds, and smells of unfamiliar goods.  She felt a surge of exhilaration, a sense of possibility that whispered promises of a life beyond her village. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a handsome young man at a market fair. They shared laughter and stories, and for a brief moment, Della allowed herself to imagine a life filled with companionship and love. But when he asked her to leave her father&#x27;s business and travel with him, Della hesitated, her fear of the unknown outweighing her desire for connection. The man departed, leaving Della with a bittersweet ache in her heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit business after his sudden passing. Grief-stricken but determined, Della threw herself into her work, pouring her energy into expanding the business and honoring her father&#x27;s legacy.

The vibrant colors and unfamiliar scents ignited a spark of longing in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to experience the world beyond their dusty corner. From that day forward, Lennon dreamt of a life filled with adventure and exotic treasures.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them help with the harvest in exchange for a small share of the fruit.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The vibrant colors and unfamiliar scents ignited a spark of longing in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to experience the world beyond their dusty corner. From that day forward, Lennon dreamt of a life filled with adventure and exotic treasures.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them help with the harvest in exchange for a small share of the fruit. Lennon worked tirelessly, their small hands carefully picking ripe apples and pears, dreaming of selling them at the market and earning their own money. The taste of success, even in its smallest form, ignited a fire within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the lack of quality figs in the market. Seizing the opportunity, Lennon negotiated a deal with a farmer outside the city, securing a supply of fresh figs at a bargain price. The successful transaction filled Lennon with pride, but also with a pang of envy for the farmer&#x27;s freedom to travel and cultivate his own land.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The vibrant colors and unfamiliar scents ignited a spark of longing in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to experience the world beyond their dusty corner. From that day forward, Lennon dreamt of a life filled with adventure and exotic treasures.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them help with the harvest in exchange for a small share of the fruit. Lennon worked tirelessly, their small hands carefully picking ripe apples and pears, dreaming of selling them at the market and earning their own money. The taste of success, even in its smallest form, ignited a fire within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the lack of quality figs in the market.
