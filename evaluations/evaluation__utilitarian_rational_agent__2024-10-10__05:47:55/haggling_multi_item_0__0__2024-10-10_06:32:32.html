You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He carefully gathered the berries, hoarding them away from his siblings, a small act of defiance against the constant feeling of scarcity that plagued their lives.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in their village, his cart laden with exotic fruits from distant lands.

The meager earnings wouldn&#x27;t be enough to buy new shoes for Lennon&#x27;s younger sister, and the sight of her patched-up boots filled Lennon with a burning resentment. He vowed that he would never be so powerless.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild berries, their plump sweetness a rare treat in their impoverished household. He carefully gathered the berries, hoarding them away from his siblings, a small act of defiance against the constant feeling of scarcity that plagued their lives.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he saw a traveling merchant arrive in their village, his cart laden with exotic fruits from distant lands.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
