It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, I know we&#x27;ve been haggling for a bit, but I&#x27;m a fair man.

She loaded it with bruised and misshapen fruit, the rejects that no one else wanted, and set out on the dusty roads, determined to make her own way in the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who tried to cheat her out of a fair price for her fruit.

She vowed then and there that she would never be cheated again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck into the market after hours and stole a bruised apple from a vendor&#x27;s stall. The sweet, tart juice was a forbidden delight, a taste of rebellion against her meager rations. The thrill of the theft, the fear of being caught, ignited a spark of defiance in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the marketplace.

She loaded it with bruised and misshapen fruit, the rejects that no one else wanted, and set out on the dusty roads, determined to make her own way in the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who tried to cheat her out of a fair price for her fruit.

From that day forward, Lennon understood the delicate dance of negotiation, the art of finding common ground.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their father load the cart for the first time.  The air was thick with the scent of ripe fruit, and Lennon&#x27;s small hands struggled to lift the heavy baskets.  Despite the exhaustion, Lennon felt a surge of pride, knowing they were contributing to the family business.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they had to take over the stall for a day while their father was ill.

The customer, a gruff woman with a basket overflowing with vegetables, tried to lowball the price of a crate of mangoes. Lennon watched, wide-eyed, as his father countered her offer with a smile and a playful banter, ultimately securing a fair price. From that day forward, Lennon understood the delicate dance of negotiation, the art of finding common ground.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their father load the cart for the first time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The injustice of it burned in her chest, a hot ember of resentment that refused to be quenched. She vowed then and there that she would never be cheated again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck into the market after hours and stole a bruised apple from a vendor&#x27;s stall. The sweet, tart juice was a forbidden delight, a taste of rebellion against her meager rations. The thrill of the theft, the fear of being caught, ignited a spark of defiance in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the marketplace. She quickly learned the art of haggling, her voice growing sharper with each transaction. The sting of every insult, every attempt to undervalue their goods, fueled her growing resentment.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit stall.

Her sharp tongue and unwavering gaze earned her a reputation as a tough negotiator, but also as someone to be avoided.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, taking her meager savings and purchasing a rickety cart.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The injustice of it burned in her chest, a hot ember of resentment that refused to be quenched. She vowed then and there that she would never be cheated again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck into the market after hours and stole a bruised apple from a vendor&#x27;s stall.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

The injustice of it burned in her chest, a hot ember of resentment that refused to be quenched. She vowed then and there that she would never be cheated again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck into the market after hours and stole a bruised apple from a vendor&#x27;s stall. The sweet, tart juice was a forbidden delight, a taste of rebellion against her meager rations. The thrill of the theft, the fear of being caught, ignited a spark of defiance in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the marketplace. She quickly learned the art of haggling, her voice growing sharper with each transaction. The sting of every insult, every attempt to undervalue their goods, fueled her growing resentment.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit stall. She implemented her own pricing strategies, refusing to be bullied by customers. Her sharp tongue and unwavering gaze earned her a reputation as a tough negotiator, but also as someone to be avoided.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, taking her meager savings and purchasing a rickety cart. She loaded it with bruised and misshapen fruit, the rejects that no one else wanted, and set out on the dusty roads, determined to make her own way in the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who tried to cheat her out of a fair price for her fruit. Enraged, she confronted him, her voice ringing out across the marketplace. She exposed his deception, shaming him in front of the other vendors and customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
