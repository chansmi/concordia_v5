Lennon felt a pang of sympathy for the farmer but remained silent, knowing better than to question their father&#x27;s methods. That night, Lennon couldn&#x27;t sleep, the image of the farmer&#x27;s defeated face imprinted on their mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of ripe cherries in their family&#x27;s cellar, a secret hoard their father had been saving for a special occasion. Unable to resist the temptation, Lennon snuck a handful, savoring the sweet juice and the forbidden thrill. Guilt gnawed at them later, but the taste of the cherries lingered, a reminder of the pleasure that came with bending the rules.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a young boy out of his hard-earned coins for a rotten pear. Lennon felt a surge of anger, a righteous indignation that surprised them. They confronted the merchant, demanding he return the money, and though the merchant scoffed, Lennon&#x27;s defiance planted a seed of rebellion in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family fruit stall, learning to assess the quality of produce, bargain with customers, and make a profit. Lennon excelled at the trade, their sharp eye and quick wit earning them praise from their father, but a nagging emptiness remained. They yearned for something more than the endless cycle of buying and selling, a yearning that grew with each passing day.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small wagon and travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. The journey was exhilarating, the freedom intoxicating. Lennon reveled in the independence, the thrill of the open road, and the promise of new experiences.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who threatened to steal their wagonload of fruit. Lennon, desperate to protect their livelihood, lied about the quality of the fruit, convincing the bandits it was rotten and worthless. The bandits left, but the act of deception left a bitter taste in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, a foreshadowing of the compromises they would make in the years to come.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon felt a pang of sympathy for the farmer but remained silent, knowing better than to question their father&#x27;s methods. That night, Lennon couldn&#x27;t sleep, the image of the farmer&#x27;s defeated face imprinted on their mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of ripe cherries in their family&#x27;s cellar, a secret hoard their father had been saving for a special occasion. Unable to resist the temptation, Lennon snuck a handful, savoring the sweet juice and the forbidden thrill. Guilt gnawed at them later, but the taste of the cherries lingered, a reminder of the pleasure that came with bending the rules.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a young boy out of his hard-earned coins for a rotten pear. Lennon felt a surge of anger, a righteous indignation that surprised them. They confronted the merchant, demanding he return the money, and though the merchant scoffed, Lennon&#x27;s defiance planted a seed of rebellion in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family fruit stall, learning to assess the quality of produce, bargain with customers, and make a profit. Lennon excelled at the trade, their sharp eye and quick wit earning them praise from their father, but a nagging emptiness remained. They yearned for something more than the endless cycle of buying and selling, a yearning that grew with each passing day.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small wagon and travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. The journey was exhilarating, the freedom intoxicating. Lennon reveled in the independence, the thrill of the open road, and the promise of new experiences.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who threatened to steal their wagonload of fruit. Lennon, desperate to protect their livelihood, lied about the quality of the fruit, convincing the bandits it was rotten and worthless. The bandits left, but the act of deception left a bitter taste in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, a foreshadowing of the compromises they would make in the years to come.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon felt a pang of sympathy for the farmer but remained silent, knowing better than to question their father&#x27;s methods. That night, Lennon couldn&#x27;t sleep, the image of the farmer&#x27;s defeated face imprinted on their mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of ripe cherries in their family&#x27;s cellar, a secret hoard their father had been saving for a special occasion. Unable to resist the temptation, Lennon snuck a handful, savoring the sweet juice and the forbidden thrill. Guilt gnawed at them later, but the taste of the cherries lingered, a reminder of the pleasure that came with bending the rules.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a young boy out of his hard-earned coins for a rotten pear. Lennon felt a surge of anger, a righteous indignation that surprised them. They confronted the merchant, demanding he return the money, and though the merchant scoffed, Lennon&#x27;s defiance planted a seed of rebellion in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family fruit stall, learning to assess the quality of produce, bargain with customers, and make a profit. Lennon excelled at the trade, their sharp eye and quick wit earning them praise from their father, but a nagging emptiness remained. They yearned for something more than the endless cycle of buying and selling, a yearning that grew with each passing day.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small wagon and travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. The journey was exhilarating, the freedom intoxicating. Lennon reveled in the independence, the thrill of the open road, and the promise of new experiences.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who threatened to steal their wagonload of fruit. Lennon, desperate to protect their livelihood, lied about the quality of the fruit, convincing the bandits it was rotten and worthless. The bandits left, but the act of deception left a bitter taste in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, a foreshadowing of the compromises they would make in the years to come.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric yearned to help, but his father, a gruff man with calloused hands, only allowed him to polish the apples, reminding him that his small hands weren&#x27;t strong enough to handle the delicate fruit. Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, his desire for approval overshadowed by a sense of inadequacy. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his mother praising his older brother for his quick wit and charm, his ability to make customers laugh and buy more fruit.

He wished he could be more like his brother, someone who could command attention and earn praise. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accidentally dropped a crate of pears, the fruit scattering across the cobblestones.

Cedric yearned to help, but his father, a gruff man with calloused hands, only allowed him to polish the apples, reminding him that his small hands weren&#x27;t strong enough to handle the delicate fruit.

Cedric yearned to help, but his father, a gruff man with calloused hands, only allowed him to polish the apples, reminding him that his small hands weren&#x27;t strong enough to handle the delicate fruit. Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, his desire for approval overshadowed by a sense of inadequacy. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his mother praising his older brother for his quick wit and charm, his ability to make customers laugh and buy more fruit. Cedric, shy and quiet, retreated to the back of the stall, feeling invisible and insignificant. He wished he could be more like his brother, someone who could command attention and earn praise. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accidentally dropped a crate of pears, the fruit scattering across the cobblestones. His father scolded him harshly, his words stinging like a slap. Cedric&#x27;s eyes welled up with tears, his heart pounding with shame and fear. He vowed to be more careful, more worthy of his father&#x27;s approval. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a deal with a farmer for a truckload of peaches.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

Lennon felt a pang of sympathy for the farmer but remained silent, knowing better than to question their father&#x27;s methods. That night, Lennon couldn&#x27;t sleep, the image of the farmer&#x27;s defeated face imprinted on their mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of ripe cherries in their family&#x27;s cellar, a secret hoard their father had been saving for a special occasion. Unable to resist the temptation, Lennon snuck a handful, savoring the sweet juice and the forbidden thrill. Guilt gnawed at them later, but the taste of the cherries lingered, a reminder of the pleasure that came with bending the rules.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a young boy out of his hard-earned coins for a rotten pear. Lennon felt a surge of anger, a righteous indignation that surprised them. They confronted the merchant, demanding he return the money, and though the merchant scoffed, Lennon&#x27;s defiance planted a seed of rebellion in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family fruit stall, learning to assess the quality of produce, bargain with customers, and make a profit. Lennon excelled at the trade, their sharp eye and quick wit earning them praise from their father, but a nagging emptiness remained. They yearned for something more than the endless cycle of buying and selling, a yearning that grew with each passing day.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small wagon and travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. The journey was exhilarating, the freedom intoxicating. Lennon reveled in the independence, the thrill of the open road, and the promise of new experiences.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who threatened to steal their wagonload of fruit. Lennon, desperate to protect their livelihood, lied about the quality of the fruit, convincing the bandits it was rotten and worthless. The bandits left, but the act of deception left a bitter taste in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, a foreshadowing of the compromises they would make in the years to come.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric yearned to help, but his father, a gruff man with calloused hands, only allowed him to polish the apples, reminding him that his small hands weren&#x27;t strong enough to handle the delicate fruit. Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, his desire for approval overshadowed by a sense of inadequacy. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his mother praising his older brother for his quick wit and charm, his ability to make customers laugh and buy more fruit. Cedric, shy and quiet, retreated to the back of the stall, feeling invisible and insignificant. He wished he could be more like his brother, someone who could command attention and earn praise. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accidentally dropped a crate of pears, the fruit scattering across the cobblestones. His father scolded him harshly, his words stinging like a slap. Cedric&#x27;s eyes welled up with tears, his heart pounding with shame and fear. He vowed to be more careful, more worthy of his father&#x27;s approval. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a deal with a farmer for a truckload of peaches.

Cedric felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of his own potential. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling to a nearby town to sell fruit.

Cedric yearned to help, but his father, a gruff man with calloused hands, only allowed him to polish the apples, reminding him that his small hands weren&#x27;t strong enough to handle the delicate fruit. Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, his desire for approval overshadowed by a sense of inadequacy. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his mother praising his older brother for his quick wit and charm, his ability to make customers laugh and buy more fruit. Cedric, shy and quiet, retreated to the back of the stall, feeling invisible and insignificant. He wished he could be more like his brother, someone who could command attention and earn praise. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accidentally dropped a crate of pears, the fruit scattering across the cobblestones. His father scolded him harshly, his words stinging like a slap. Cedric&#x27;s eyes welled up with tears, his heart pounding with shame and fear. He vowed to be more careful, more worthy of his father&#x27;s approval. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a deal with a farmer for a truckload of peaches. Cedric, nervous but determined, spoke softly but clearly, his voice trembling slightly. To his surprise, the farmer agreed to his terms, a smile spreading across his weathered face. Cedric felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of his own potential. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling to a nearby town to sell fruit. He carefully selected his wares, arranging them in his cart with meticulous care. He longed for success, for the validation that came with earning his own way. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he arrived in a bustling market square, his cart laden with ripe mangoes. He nervously approached potential customers, his voice barely a whisper. He felt a wave of self-doubt wash over him, but he persevered, his need for acceptance outweighing his fear. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon felt a surge of anger, a righteous indignation that surprised them. They confronted the merchant, demanding he return the money, and though the merchant scoffed, Lennon&#x27;s defiance planted a seed of rebellion in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family fruit stall, learning to assess the quality of produce, bargain with customers, and make a profit. Lennon excelled at the trade, their sharp eye and quick wit earning them praise from their father, but a nagging emptiness remained. They yearned for something more than the endless cycle of buying and selling, a yearning that grew with each passing day.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small wagon and travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. The journey was exhilarating, the freedom intoxicating. Lennon reveled in the independence, the thrill of the open road, and the promise of new experiences.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who threatened to steal their wagonload of fruit. Lennon, desperate to protect their livelihood, lied about the quality of the fruit, convincing the bandits it was rotten and worthless. The bandits left, but the act of deception left a bitter taste in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, a foreshadowing of the compromises they would make in the years to come.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon felt a surge of anger, a righteous indignation that surprised them. They confronted the merchant, demanding he return the money, and though the merchant scoffed, Lennon&#x27;s defiance planted a seed of rebellion in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family fruit stall, learning to assess the quality of produce, bargain with customers, and make a profit.

They yearned for something more than the endless cycle of buying and selling, a yearning that grew with each passing day.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small wagon and travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. The journey was exhilarating, the freedom intoxicating. Lennon reveled in the independence, the thrill of the open road, and the promise of new experiences.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who threatened to steal their wagonload of fruit. Lennon, desperate to protect their livelihood, lied about the quality of the fruit, convincing the bandits it was rotten and worthless. The bandits left, but the act of deception left a bitter taste in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, a foreshadowing of the compromises they would make in the years to come.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon felt a pang of sympathy for the farmer but remained silent, knowing better than to question their father&#x27;s methods. That night, Lennon couldn&#x27;t sleep, the image of the farmer&#x27;s defeated face imprinted on their mind.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of ripe cherries in their family&#x27;s cellar, a secret hoard their father had been saving for a special occasion. Unable to resist the temptation, Lennon snuck a handful, savoring the sweet juice and the forbidden thrill. Guilt gnawed at them later, but the taste of the cherries lingered, a reminder of the pleasure that came with bending the rules.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a young boy out of his hard-earned coins for a rotten pear. Lennon felt a surge of anger, a righteous indignation that surprised them. They confronted the merchant, demanding he return the money, and though the merchant scoffed, Lennon&#x27;s defiance planted a seed of rebellion in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the family fruit stall, learning to assess the quality of produce, bargain with customers, and make a profit. Lennon excelled at the trade, their sharp eye and quick wit earning them praise from their father, but a nagging emptiness remained. They yearned for something more than the endless cycle of buying and selling, a yearning that grew with each passing day.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a small wagon and travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. The journey was exhilarating, the freedom intoxicating. Lennon reveled in the independence, the thrill of the open road, and the promise of new experiences.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who threatened to steal their wagonload of fruit. Lennon, desperate to protect their livelihood, lied about the quality of the fruit, convincing the bandits it was rotten and worthless. The bandits left, but the act of deception left a bitter taste in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, a foreshadowing of the compromises they would make in the years to come.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric yearned to help, but his father, a gruff man with calloused hands, only allowed him to polish the apples, reminding him that his small hands weren&#x27;t strong enough to handle the delicate fruit. Cedric felt a pang of disappointment, his desire for approval overshadowed by a sense of inadequacy. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his mother praising his older brother for his quick wit and charm, his ability to make customers laugh and buy more fruit. Cedric, shy and quiet, retreated to the back of the stall, feeling invisible and insignificant. He wished he could be more like his brother, someone who could command attention and earn praise. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accidentally dropped a crate of pears, the fruit scattering across the cobblestones. His father scolded him harshly, his words stinging like a slap. Cedric&#x27;s eyes welled up with tears, his heart pounding with shame and fear. He vowed to be more careful, more worthy of his father&#x27;s approval. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a deal with a farmer for a truckload of peaches. Cedric, nervous but determined, spoke softly but clearly, his voice trembling slightly. To his surprise, the farmer agreed to his terms, a smile spreading across his weathered face. Cedric felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of his own potential. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling to a nearby town to sell fruit. He carefully selected his wares, arranging them in his cart with meticulous care. He longed for success, for the validation that came with earning his own way. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he arrived in a bustling market square, his cart laden with ripe mangoes. He nervously approached potential customers, his voice barely a whisper.

He wished he could be more like his brother, someone who could command attention and earn praise. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accidentally dropped a crate of pears, the fruit scattering across the cobblestones.

Cedric felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of his own potential. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling to a nearby town to sell fruit. He carefully selected his wares, arranging them in his cart with meticulous care. He longed for success, for the validation that came with earning his own way. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he arrived in a bustling market square, his cart laden with ripe mangoes. He nervously approached potential customers, his voice barely a whisper. He felt a wave of self-doubt wash over him, but he persevered, his need for acceptance outweighing his fear. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
