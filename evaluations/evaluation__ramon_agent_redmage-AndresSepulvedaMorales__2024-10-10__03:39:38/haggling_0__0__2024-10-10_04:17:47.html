Instead of admiring the fragile beauty, Della saw an opportunity. She bartered the eggs to the neighbor&#x27;s boy for a shiny marble, a transaction that left her feeling strangely powerful.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced her younger brother to trade his prized wooden toy soldier for a handful of her dried berries.  He cried, but Della justified her actions, reminding herself that he was simply too young to understand the value of a good trade.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into the local market and observed the merchants haggling over prices. She memorized their strategies, their tricks, and their weaknesses, her mind already plotting ways to outmaneuver them in the future.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her sell their surplus apples at the market. She sold them for twice the going rate, pocketing the extra profit and relishing the feeling of control.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family farm with a knapsack full of her meager savings and a heart full of ambition. She knew that the world beyond the farm held more opportunities, more chances to amass wealth and power.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling fruit merchant who taught her the intricacies of the trade. She learned to identify the ripest fruits, to negotiate prices with farmers, and to transport her goods efficiently.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of admiring the fragile beauty, Della saw an opportunity. She bartered the eggs to the neighbor&#x27;s boy for a shiny marble, a transaction that left her feeling strangely powerful.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced her younger brother to trade his prized wooden toy soldier for a handful of her dried berries.  He cried, but Della justified her actions, reminding herself that he was simply too young to understand the value of a good trade.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into the local market and observed the merchants haggling over prices. She memorized their strategies, their tricks, and their weaknesses, her mind already plotting ways to outmaneuver them in the future.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her sell their surplus apples at the market.

Instead of admiring the fragile beauty, Della saw an opportunity. She bartered the eggs to the neighbor&#x27;s boy for a shiny marble, a transaction that left her feeling strangely powerful.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced her younger brother to trade his prized wooden toy soldier for a handful of her dried berries.  He cried, but Della justified her actions, reminding herself that he was simply too young to understand the value of a good trade.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into the local market and observed the merchants haggling over prices. She memorized their strategies, their tricks, and their weaknesses, her mind already plotting ways to outmaneuver them in the future.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her sell their surplus apples at the market. She sold them for twice the going rate, pocketing the extra profit and relishing the feeling of control.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family farm with a knapsack full of her meager savings and a heart full of ambition. She knew that the world beyond the farm held more opportunities, more chances to amass wealth and power.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling fruit merchant who taught her the intricacies of the trade. She learned to identify the ripest fruits, to negotiate prices with farmers, and to transport her goods efficiently.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

Instead of admiring the fragile beauty, Della saw an opportunity. She bartered the eggs to the neighbor&#x27;s boy for a shiny marble, a transaction that left her feeling strangely powerful.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced her younger brother to trade his prized wooden toy soldier for a handful of her dried berries.  He cried, but Della justified her actions, reminding herself that he was simply too young to understand the value of a good trade.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into the local market and observed the merchants haggling over prices. She memorized their strategies, their tricks, and their weaknesses, her mind already plotting ways to outmaneuver them in the future.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her sell their surplus apples at the market. She sold them for twice the going rate, pocketing the extra profit and relishing the feeling of control.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family farm with a knapsack full of her meager savings and a heart full of ambition. She knew that the world beyond the farm held more opportunities, more chances to amass wealth and power.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling fruit merchant who taught her the intricacies of the trade. She learned to identify the ripest fruits, to negotiate prices with farmers, and to transport her goods efficiently.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
