Della mimicked her mother&#x27;s confident stance and practiced her most serious expression, earning a chuckle from her mother and a small, bruised mango as a reward.  From that day forward, Della was determined to learn the art of negotiation, eager to follow in her mother&#x27;s footsteps.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, a sudden hailstorm ravaged the marketplace, destroying much of the fruit stock. Della, heartbroken to see the livelihoods of her fellow vendors threatened, spent the day helping to salvage what remained, her small hands working tirelessly alongside the adults.  She learned the importance of community and the power of collective resilience in the face of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she made her first solo trip to a neighboring village to purchase fruit for resale. She carefully selected the ripest peaches and juiciest plums, her knowledge of fruit passed down from her mother guiding her choices.  Returning home with a cart full of fragrant fruit, Della felt a surge of pride and a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she encountered a group of bandits who attempted to steal her earnings. Della, though small in stature, stood her ground, her voice unwavering as she refused to relinquish her hard-earned coins. The bandits, surprised by her defiance, eventually backed down, leaving Della with a profound understanding of the importance of courage and self-reliance.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a distant city renowned for its exotic fruits.  She marveled at the vibrant colors and intoxicating scents of fruits she had never seen before, her heart filled with a thirst for new experiences and a desire to expand her knowledge.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced a devastating loss when a fire swept through the marketplace, destroying her cart and all her belongings.

Della mimicked her mother&#x27;s confident stance and practiced her most serious expression, earning a chuckle from her mother and a small, bruised mango as a reward.  From that day forward, Della was determined to learn the art of negotiation, eager to follow in her mother&#x27;s footsteps.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, a sudden hailstorm ravaged the marketplace, destroying much of the fruit stock. Della, heartbroken to see the livelihoods of her fellow vendors threatened, spent the day helping to salvage what remained, her small hands working tirelessly alongside the adults.  She learned the importance of community and the power of collective resilience in the face of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she made her first solo trip to a neighboring village to purchase fruit for resale. She carefully selected the ripest peaches and juiciest plums, her knowledge of fruit passed down from her mother guiding her choices.  Returning home with a cart full of fragrant fruit, Della felt a surge of pride and a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she encountered a group of bandits who attempted to steal her earnings. Della, though small in stature, stood her ground, her voice unwavering as she refused to relinquish her hard-earned coins. The bandits, surprised by her defiance, eventually backed down, leaving Della with a profound understanding of the importance of courage and self-reliance.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a distant city renowned for its exotic fruits.  She marveled at the vibrant colors and intoxicating scents of fruits she had never seen before, her heart filled with a thirst for new experiences and a desire to expand her knowledge.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced a devastating loss when a fire swept through the marketplace, destroying her cart and all her belongings.  Despite the overwhelming grief and despair, Della refused to give up. She borrowed a small amount of money from a trusted friend and started anew, her spirit unbroken by the tragedy.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is important to play the role of a person like Della Plumstone as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Della Plumstone would respond, and taking into account all information about Della Plumstone that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-15 00:10:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree rejected the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Lennon Figtree rejected the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.
