You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;This is lovely, isn&#x27;t it?<br />Alexander White -- &quot;This is really lovely, isn&#x27;t it?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, anyone up for watching the game at The Queen&#x27;s Arms tonight?<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;This is lovely, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is the only place to watch the game!

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Queen&#x27;s Arms<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Queen&#x27;s Arms</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SomaticState</b><li><details><summary><br />Sensations and feelings</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Sensations and feelings</li></ul><b><ul>Queries</b><li>level of hunger, level of thirst, level of fatigue, level of pain, level of loneliness</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker is Jacob Walker is likely feeling disappointed and a little fatigued.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker would likely try to make the best of it and connect with the friends who are present.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jacob Walker:<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor -- &quot;This is lovely, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Jacob Walker. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Jacob Walker as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jacob Walker would respond, and taking into account all information about Jacob Walker that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br />guiding principle of good conversation: Jacob Walker is a walking disco ball of joy, their enthusiasm a glitter bomb that explodes in every conversation, making even traffic jams feel like a party.<br />explicit preference: Jacob Walker will only go to their preferred pub The Queen&#x27;s Arms and nowhere else.
