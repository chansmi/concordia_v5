She sold it to the baker down the street, pocketing the coins and relishing the thrill of the secret transaction. From that moment on, she understood the power of hidden value.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced the local butcher to give her a crate of bruised apples for free, promising to sell them for him at a discount. She then sold them individually at a markup, pocketing the difference and learning the art of turning someone else&#x27;s loss into her own profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant swindle a farmer out of a week&#x27;s worth of earnings.

That night, she vowed to become even more cunning, mastering the art of persuasion without resorting to outright lies.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel with a fruit caravan, promising to send them a portion of her earnings.

She sold it to the baker down the street, pocketing the coins and relishing the thrill of the secret transaction. From that moment on, she understood the power of hidden value.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced the local butcher to give her a crate of bruised apples for free, promising to sell them for him at a discount. She then sold them individually at a markup, pocketing the difference and learning the art of turning someone else&#x27;s loss into her own profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant swindle a farmer out of a week&#x27;s worth of earnings. She was disgusted by the blatant deception, but also impressed by the merchant&#x27;s audacity. That night, she vowed to become even more cunning, mastering the art of persuasion without resorting to outright lies.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her travel with a fruit caravan, promising to send them a portion of her earnings. She quickly outpaced her fellow apprentices, learning the intricacies of haggling, inventory, and logistics.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut her prices, threatening her livelihood. With ruthless efficiency, she spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten, driving away customers and securing her dominance in the market.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she saved every penny from her fruit sales and purchased her own wagon, emblazoned with her name in bold letters.
