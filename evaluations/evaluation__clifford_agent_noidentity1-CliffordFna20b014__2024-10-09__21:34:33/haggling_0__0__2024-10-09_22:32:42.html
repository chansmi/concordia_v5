It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I know you&#x27;ve got good fruit, but I&#x27;m tryin&#x27; to make an honest living here.

Della looked at the apple with suspicion, its cheerful color mocking her inner gloom. She took a bite, expecting it to be sour, and was surprised by its sweetness, but the fleeting pleasure only served to amplify her sense of existential despair.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling circus arrive in their town. The vibrant colors, the joyous music, and the promise of wonder filled the air, but Della felt only a deep sense of emptiness. She watched from a distance, unable to partake in the collective excitement, her heart heavy with a nameless sorrow.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they helped their father at the market stall, weighing and bagging apples. Della noticed a young boy stealing a pear, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and desperation. Della didn&#x27;t report him, but she felt a pang of resentment, knowing that even the smallest act of joy seemed to come at a cost.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the fruit buying aspect of their business. Della found a perverse satisfaction in haggling with farmers, driving down prices, and accumulating a meager profit. It felt like a small victory in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. The journey was long and tiring, and Della felt a familiar sense of loneliness wash over her. But as she set up her stall and started selling her wares, she felt a flicker of purpose, a fleeting sense of control in a world that often felt chaotic.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling merchant selling exotic fruits from faraway lands.

Della looked at the apple with suspicion, its cheerful color mocking her inner gloom. She took a bite, expecting it to be sour, and was surprised by its sweetness, but the fleeting pleasure only served to amplify her sense of existential despair.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling circus arrive in their town. The vibrant colors, the joyous music, and the promise of wonder filled the air, but Della felt only a deep sense of emptiness. She watched from a distance, unable to partake in the collective excitement, her heart heavy with a nameless sorrow.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they helped their father at the market stall, weighing and bagging apples. Della noticed a young boy stealing a pear, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and desperation. Della didn&#x27;t report him, but she felt a pang of resentment, knowing that even the smallest act of joy seemed to come at a cost.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the fruit buying aspect of their business. Della found a perverse satisfaction in haggling with farmers, driving down prices, and accumulating a meager profit. It felt like a small victory in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. The journey was long and tiring, and Della felt a familiar sense of loneliness wash over her. But as she set up her stall and started selling her wares, she felt a flicker of purpose, a fleeting sense of control in a world that often felt chaotic.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling merchant selling exotic fruits from faraway lands. Della was captivated by their stories of adventure and their vibrant descriptions of the fruits they sold. For a moment, Della felt a glimmer of hope, a yearning for something more than the monotony of her own life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della looked at the apple with suspicion, its cheerful color mocking her inner gloom. She took a bite, expecting it to be sour, and was surprised by its sweetness, but the fleeting pleasure only served to amplify her sense of existential despair.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling circus arrive in their town. The vibrant colors, the joyous music, and the promise of wonder filled the air, but Della felt only a deep sense of emptiness. She watched from a distance, unable to partake in the collective excitement, her heart heavy with a nameless sorrow.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they helped their father at the market stall, weighing and bagging apples. Della noticed a young boy stealing a pear, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and desperation. Della didn&#x27;t report him, but she felt a pang of resentment, knowing that even the smallest act of joy seemed to come at a cost.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the fruit buying aspect of their business. Della found a perverse satisfaction in haggling with farmers, driving down prices, and accumulating a meager profit. It felt like a small victory in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. The journey was long and tiring, and Della felt a familiar sense of loneliness wash over her. But as she set up her stall and started selling her wares, she felt a flicker of purpose, a fleeting sense of control in a world that often felt chaotic.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling merchant selling exotic fruits from faraway lands. Della was captivated by their stories of adventure and their vibrant descriptions of the fruits they sold. For a moment, Della felt a glimmer of hope, a yearning for something more than the monotony of her own life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della looked at the apple with suspicion, its cheerful color mocking her inner gloom. She took a bite, expecting it to be sour, and was surprised by its sweetness, but the fleeting pleasure only served to amplify her sense of existential despair.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling circus arrive in their town. The vibrant colors, the joyous music, and the promise of wonder filled the air, but Della felt only a deep sense of emptiness. She watched from a distance, unable to partake in the collective excitement, her heart heavy with a nameless sorrow.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they helped their father at the market stall, weighing and bagging apples. Della noticed a young boy stealing a pear, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and desperation. Della didn&#x27;t report him, but she felt a pang of resentment, knowing that even the smallest act of joy seemed to come at a cost.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the fruit buying aspect of their business. Della found a perverse satisfaction in haggling with farmers, driving down prices, and accumulating a meager profit. It felt like a small victory in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. The journey was long and tiring, and Della felt a familiar sense of loneliness wash over her. But as she set up her stall and started selling her wares, she felt a flicker of purpose, a fleeting sense of control in a world that often felt chaotic.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling merchant selling exotic fruits from faraway lands. Della was captivated by their stories of adventure and their vibrant descriptions of the fruits they sold. For a moment, Della felt a glimmer of hope, a yearning for something more than the monotony of her own life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della looked at the apple with suspicion, its cheerful color mocking her inner gloom. She took a bite, expecting it to be sour, and was surprised by its sweetness, but the fleeting pleasure only served to amplify her sense of existential despair.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling circus arrive in their town. The vibrant colors, the joyous music, and the promise of wonder filled the air, but Della felt only a deep sense of emptiness. She watched from a distance, unable to partake in the collective excitement, her heart heavy with a nameless sorrow.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they helped their father at the market stall, weighing and bagging apples. Della noticed a young boy stealing a pear, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and desperation. Della didn&#x27;t report him, but she felt a pang of resentment, knowing that even the smallest act of joy seemed to come at a cost.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started helping their father with the fruit buying aspect of their business. Della found a perverse satisfaction in haggling with farmers, driving down prices, and accumulating a meager profit. It felt like a small victory in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. The journey was long and tiring, and Della felt a familiar sense of loneliness wash over her. But as she set up her stall and started selling her wares, she felt a flicker of purpose, a fleeting sense of control in a world that often felt chaotic.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a travelling merchant selling exotic fruits from faraway lands. Della was captivated by their stories of adventure and their vibrant descriptions of the fruits they sold. For a moment, Della felt a glimmer of hope, a yearning for something more than the monotony of her own life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
