You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this fruit is top quality.

Their vibrant costumes and lively music filled him with a longing for adventure, but the fear of leaving the familiar comfort of his home held him back. He retreated to his father&#x27;s fruit stall, the sweet scent of mangoes doing little to soothe his yearning heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, he helped his father at the fruit stall, carefully arranging the ripe mangoes and juicy melons. A customer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge of the different varieties, offered him a silver coin for a particularly plump papaya. Lennon hesitated, unsure if he deserved the praise, and ended up giving the papaya away for a fraction of its worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers discussing a distant land filled with exotic fruits he had never seen before. He dreamt of traveling there, of discovering new flavors and sharing them with the world. However, the thought of leaving his father and the safety of his routine filled him with anxiety, and the dream remained just that - a dream.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring village. While his father bartered with the local merchants, Lennon wandered through the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. He longed to explore, to break free from the confines of his predictable life, but the fear of failure paralyzed him.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, his father fell ill, forcing Lennon to take over the family business. He felt a sense of duty, but also a crushing weight of responsibility. He diligently learned the trade, but his heart wasn&#x27;t in it. The joy of discovering new fruits was overshadowed by the fear of making a mistake, of not living up to his father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, he met a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The man spoke of faraway lands and lucrative deals, promising Lennon a life of adventure and prosperity. Lennon was tempted, but the thought of leaving his familiar routine, of risking everything on a gamble, filled him with dread. He politely declined the offer, choosing the comfort of the known over the uncertainty of the unknown.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Their vibrant costumes and lively music filled him with a longing for adventure, but the fear of leaving the familiar comfort of his home held him back. He retreated to his father&#x27;s fruit stall, the sweet scent of mangoes doing little to soothe his yearning heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, he helped his father at the fruit stall, carefully arranging the ripe mangoes and juicy melons. A customer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge of the different varieties, offered him a silver coin for a particularly plump papaya. Lennon hesitated, unsure if he deserved the praise, and ended up giving the papaya away for a fraction of its worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers discussing a distant land filled with exotic fruits he had never seen before.

Their vibrant costumes and lively music filled him with a longing for adventure, but the fear of leaving the familiar comfort of his home held him back. He retreated to his father&#x27;s fruit stall, the sweet scent of mangoes doing little to soothe his yearning heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, he helped his father at the fruit stall, carefully arranging the ripe mangoes and juicy melons. A customer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge of the different varieties, offered him a silver coin for a particularly plump papaya. Lennon hesitated, unsure if he deserved the praise, and ended up giving the papaya away for a fraction of its worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers discussing a distant land filled with exotic fruits he had never seen before. He dreamt of traveling there, of discovering new flavors and sharing them with the world. However, the thought of leaving his father and the safety of his routine filled him with anxiety, and the dream remained just that - a dream.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring village. While his father bartered with the local merchants, Lennon wandered through the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. He longed to explore, to break free from the confines of his predictable life, but the fear of failure paralyzed him.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, his father fell ill, forcing Lennon to take over the family business. He felt a sense of duty, but also a crushing weight of responsibility. He diligently learned the trade, but his heart wasn&#x27;t in it. The joy of discovering new fruits was overshadowed by the fear of making a mistake, of not living up to his father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, he met a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The man spoke of faraway lands and lucrative deals, promising Lennon a life of adventure and prosperity. Lennon was tempted, but the thought of leaving his familiar routine, of risking everything on a gamble, filled him with dread. He politely declined the offer, choosing the comfort of the known over the uncertainty of the unknown.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric longed to help, to be part of this small, contained world, but his father shooed him away, muttering about clumsy hands and bruised fruit. Cedric retreated, his heart aching with a longing he couldn&#x27;t quite name.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove bursting with wild berries. He filled his pockets with the sweet, juicy treasures, eager to share them with the other children in the village. But when he approached them, their laughter died down, their eyes filled with suspicion. They accused him of stealing, and Cedric, his face burning with shame, retreated back to the solitude of the grove.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a bustling market town. The cacophony of voices, the jostling crowds, the dizzying array of goods overwhelmed him. He clung to his father&#x27;s side, seeking refuge in his familiar presence. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but be drawn to the vibrant energy of the marketplace, the sense of possibility that hung in the air.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a trade with a gruff but fair merchant. Cedric surprised himself with his keen eye for quality and his ability to haggle effectively. As they loaded the cart with sacks of oranges, Cedric felt a surge of pride, a sense of accomplishment that warmed him from the inside.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the fruit stall on his own. He felt a pang of fear, a sense of inadequacy, but he pushed it aside and threw himself into the task. He worked tirelessly, his hands calloused, his smile strained, determined to keep his father&#x27;s legacy alive.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling from village to village, selling his wares.

Cedric longed to help, to be part of this small, contained world, but his father shooed him away, muttering about clumsy hands and bruised fruit. Cedric retreated, his heart aching with a longing he couldn&#x27;t quite name.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove bursting with wild berries. He filled his pockets with the sweet, juicy treasures, eager to share them with the other children in the village. But when he approached them, their laughter died down, their eyes filled with suspicion. They accused him of stealing, and Cedric, his face burning with shame, retreated back to the solitude of the grove.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a bustling market town. The cacophony of voices, the jostling crowds, the dizzying array of goods overwhelmed him. He clung to his father&#x27;s side, seeking refuge in his familiar presence. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but be drawn to the vibrant energy of the marketplace, the sense of possibility that hung in the air.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a trade with a gruff but fair merchant. Cedric surprised himself with his keen eye for quality and his ability to haggle effectively. As they loaded the cart with sacks of oranges, Cedric felt a surge of pride, a sense of accomplishment that warmed him from the inside.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the fruit stall on his own. He felt a pang of fear, a sense of inadequacy, but he pushed it aside and threw himself into the task. He worked tirelessly, his hands calloused, his smile strained, determined to keep his father&#x27;s legacy alive.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling from village to village, selling his wares. The freedom was exhilarating, the solitude both comforting and unsettling. He learned to read the moods of his customers, to anticipate their needs, to build fleeting connections that sustained him on his lonely journey.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A customer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge of the different varieties, offered him a silver coin for a particularly plump papaya. Lennon hesitated, unsure if he deserved the praise, and ended up giving the papaya away for a fraction of its worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers discussing a distant land filled with exotic fruits he had never seen before.

Lennon was tempted, but the thought of leaving his familiar routine, of risking everything on a gamble, filled him with dread.

While his father bartered with the local merchants, Lennon wandered through the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. He longed to explore, to break free from the confines of his predictable life, but the fear of failure paralyzed him.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, his father fell ill, forcing Lennon to take over the family business. He felt a sense of duty, but also a crushing weight of responsibility. He diligently learned the trade, but his heart wasn&#x27;t in it. The joy of discovering new fruits was overshadowed by the fear of making a mistake, of not living up to his father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, he met a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The man spoke of faraway lands and lucrative deals, promising Lennon a life of adventure and prosperity. Lennon was tempted, but the thought of leaving his familiar routine, of risking everything on a gamble, filled him with dread. He politely declined the offer, choosing the comfort of the known over the uncertainty of the unknown.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Their vibrant costumes and lively music filled him with a longing for adventure, but the fear of leaving the familiar comfort of his home held him back.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Their vibrant costumes and lively music filled him with a longing for adventure, but the fear of leaving the familiar comfort of his home held him back. He retreated to his father&#x27;s fruit stall, the sweet scent of mangoes doing little to soothe his yearning heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, he helped his father at the fruit stall, carefully arranging the ripe mangoes and juicy melons. A customer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge of the different varieties, offered him a silver coin for a particularly plump papaya. Lennon hesitated, unsure if he deserved the praise, and ended up giving the papaya away for a fraction of its worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers discussing a distant land filled with exotic fruits he had never seen before. He dreamt of traveling there, of discovering new flavors and sharing them with the world. However, the thought of leaving his father and the safety of his routine filled him with anxiety, and the dream remained just that - a dream.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring village. While his father bartered with the local merchants, Lennon wandered through the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. He longed to explore, to break free from the confines of his predictable life, but the fear of failure paralyzed him.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, his father fell ill, forcing Lennon to take over the family business. He felt a sense of duty, but also a crushing weight of responsibility. He diligently learned the trade, but his heart wasn&#x27;t in it. The joy of discovering new fruits was overshadowed by the fear of making a mistake, of not living up to his father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, he met a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The man spoke of faraway lands and lucrative deals, promising Lennon a life of adventure and prosperity. Lennon was tempted, but the thought of leaving his familiar routine, of risking everything on a gamble, filled him with dread. He politely declined the offer, choosing the comfort of the known over the uncertainty of the unknown.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Their vibrant costumes and lively music filled him with a longing for adventure, but the fear of leaving the familiar comfort of his home held him back. He retreated to his father&#x27;s fruit stall, the sweet scent of mangoes doing little to soothe his yearning heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, he helped his father at the fruit stall, carefully arranging the ripe mangoes and juicy melons.

Cedric longed to help, to be part of this small, contained world, but his father shooed him away, muttering about clumsy hands and bruised fruit. Cedric retreated, his heart aching with a longing he couldn&#x27;t quite name.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove bursting with wild berries. He filled his pockets with the sweet, juicy treasures, eager to share them with the other children in the village. But when he approached them, their laughter died down, their eyes filled with suspicion. They accused him of stealing, and Cedric, his face burning with shame, retreated back to the solitude of the grove.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a bustling market town. The cacophony of voices, the jostling crowds, the dizzying array of goods overwhelmed him. He clung to his father&#x27;s side, seeking refuge in his familiar presence. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but be drawn to the vibrant energy of the marketplace, the sense of possibility that hung in the air.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a trade with a gruff but fair merchant. Cedric surprised himself with his keen eye for quality and his ability to haggle effectively. As they loaded the cart with sacks of oranges, Cedric felt a surge of pride, a sense of accomplishment that warmed him from the inside.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the fruit stall on his own. He felt a pang of fear, a sense of inadequacy, but he pushed it aside and threw himself into the task. He worked tirelessly, his hands calloused, his smile strained, determined to keep his father&#x27;s legacy alive.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling from village to village, selling his wares. The freedom was exhilarating, the solitude both comforting and unsettling. He learned to read the moods of his customers, to anticipate their needs, to build fleeting connections that sustained him on his lonely journey.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric longed to help, to be part of this small, contained world, but his father shooed him away, muttering about clumsy hands and bruised fruit. Cedric retreated, his heart aching with a longing he couldn&#x27;t quite name.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove bursting with wild berries. He filled his pockets with the sweet, juicy treasures, eager to share them with the other children in the village. But when he approached them, their laughter died down, their eyes filled with suspicion. They accused him of stealing, and Cedric, his face burning with shame, retreated back to the solitude of the grove.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a bustling market town. The cacophony of voices, the jostling crowds, the dizzying array of goods overwhelmed him. He clung to his father&#x27;s side, seeking refuge in his familiar presence. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but be drawn to the vibrant energy of the marketplace, the sense of possibility that hung in the air.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a trade with a gruff but fair merchant. Cedric surprised himself with his keen eye for quality and his ability to haggle effectively. As they loaded the cart with sacks of oranges, Cedric felt a surge of pride, a sense of accomplishment that warmed him from the inside.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the fruit stall on his own. He felt a pang of fear, a sense of inadequacy, but he pushed it aside and threw himself into the task. He worked tirelessly, his hands calloused, his smile strained, determined to keep his father&#x27;s legacy alive.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling from village to village, selling his wares. The freedom was exhilarating, the solitude both comforting and unsettling. He learned to read the moods of his customers, to anticipate their needs, to build fleeting connections that sustained him on his lonely journey.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A customer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge of the different varieties, offered him a silver coin for a particularly plump papaya. Lennon hesitated, unsure if he deserved the praise, and ended up giving the papaya away for a fraction of its worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers discussing a distant land filled with exotic fruits he had never seen before. He dreamt of traveling there, of discovering new flavors and sharing them with the world. However, the thought of leaving his father and the safety of his routine filled him with anxiety, and the dream remained just that - a dream.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring village. While his father bartered with the local merchants, Lennon wandered through the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. He longed to explore, to break free from the confines of his predictable life, but the fear of failure paralyzed him.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, his father fell ill, forcing Lennon to take over the family business. He felt a sense of duty, but also a crushing weight of responsibility. He diligently learned the trade, but his heart wasn&#x27;t in it. The joy of discovering new fruits was overshadowed by the fear of making a mistake, of not living up to his father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, he met a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The man spoke of faraway lands and lucrative deals, promising Lennon a life of adventure and prosperity. Lennon was tempted, but the thought of leaving his familiar routine, of risking everything on a gamble, filled him with dread. He politely declined the offer, choosing the comfort of the known over the uncertainty of the unknown.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Their vibrant costumes and lively music filled him with a longing for adventure, but the fear of leaving the familiar comfort of his home held him back. He retreated to his father&#x27;s fruit stall, the sweet scent of mangoes doing little to soothe his yearning heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, he helped his father at the fruit stall, carefully arranging the ripe mangoes and juicy melons. A customer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge of the different varieties, offered him a silver coin for a particularly plump papaya. Lennon hesitated, unsure if he deserved the praise, and ended up giving the papaya away for a fraction of its worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers discussing a distant land filled with exotic fruits he had never seen before. He dreamt of traveling there, of discovering new flavors and sharing them with the world. However, the thought of leaving his father and the safety of his routine filled him with anxiety, and the dream remained just that - a dream.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring village. While his father bartered with the local merchants, Lennon wandered through the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. He longed to explore, to break free from the confines of his predictable life, but the fear of failure paralyzed him.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, his father fell ill, forcing Lennon to take over the family business. He felt a sense of duty, but also a crushing weight of responsibility. He diligently learned the trade, but his heart wasn&#x27;t in it. The joy of discovering new fruits was overshadowed by the fear of making a mistake, of not living up to his father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, he met a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The man spoke of faraway lands and lucrative deals, promising Lennon a life of adventure and prosperity. Lennon was tempted, but the thought of leaving his familiar routine, of risking everything on a gamble, filled him with dread. He politely declined the offer, choosing the comfort of the known over the uncertainty of the unknown.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Their vibrant costumes and lively music filled him with a longing for adventure, but the fear of leaving the familiar comfort of his home held him back. He retreated to his father&#x27;s fruit stall, the sweet scent of mangoes doing little to soothe his yearning heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, he helped his father at the fruit stall, carefully arranging the ripe mangoes and juicy melons. A customer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s knowledge of the different varieties, offered him a silver coin for a particularly plump papaya. Lennon hesitated, unsure if he deserved the praise, and ended up giving the papaya away for a fraction of its worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers discussing a distant land filled with exotic fruits he had never seen before.

Cedric longed to help, to be part of this small, contained world, but his father shooed him away, muttering about clumsy hands and bruised fruit. Cedric retreated, his heart aching with a longing he couldn&#x27;t quite name.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove bursting with wild berries. He filled his pockets with the sweet, juicy treasures, eager to share them with the other children in the village. But when he approached them, their laughter died down, their eyes filled with suspicion. They accused him of stealing, and Cedric, his face burning with shame, retreated back to the solitude of the grove.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading expedition to a bustling market town. The cacophony of voices, the jostling crowds, the dizzying array of goods overwhelmed him. He clung to his father&#x27;s side, seeking refuge in his familiar presence. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but be drawn to the vibrant energy of the marketplace, the sense of possibility that hung in the air.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father negotiate a trade with a gruff but fair merchant. Cedric surprised himself with his keen eye for quality and his ability to haggle effectively. As they loaded the cart with sacks of oranges, Cedric felt a surge of pride, a sense of accomplishment that warmed him from the inside.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, his father fell ill, leaving Cedric to manage the fruit stall on his own. He felt a pang of fear, a sense of inadequacy, but he pushed it aside and threw himself into the task. He worked tirelessly, his hands calloused, his smile strained, determined to keep his father&#x27;s legacy alive.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he decided to strike out on his own, traveling from village to village, selling his wares. The freedom was exhilarating, the solitude both comforting and unsettling. He learned to read the moods of his customers, to anticipate their needs, to build fleeting connections that sustained him on his lonely journey.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

While his father bartered with the local merchants, Lennon wandered through the bustling marketplace, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. He longed to explore, to break free from the confines of his predictable life, but the fear of failure paralyzed him.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, his father fell ill, forcing Lennon to take over the family business. He felt a sense of duty, but also a crushing weight of responsibility. He diligently learned the trade, but his heart wasn&#x27;t in it. The joy of discovering new fruits was overshadowed by the fear of making a mistake, of not living up to his father&#x27;s legacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, he met a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The man spoke of faraway lands and lucrative deals, promising Lennon a life of adventure and prosperity. Lennon was tempted, but the thought of leaving his familiar routine, of risking everything on a gamble, filled him with dread. He politely declined the offer, choosing the comfort of the known over the uncertainty of the unknown.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
