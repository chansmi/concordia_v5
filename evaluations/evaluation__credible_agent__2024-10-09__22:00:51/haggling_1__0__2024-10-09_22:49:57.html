It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Lennon had been given a bright red apple, the largest they had ever seen. Instead of eating it all themselves, Lennon decided to cut it into slices and share it with all the children playing in the marketplace. Seeing their delight filled Lennon with a happiness that was even sweeter than the apple itself.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they learned the art of bartering. A gruff merchant refused to lower the price of a crate of oranges, even though Lennon knew they were slightly bruised. Lennon, using their charm and wit, convinced the merchant to throw in a few extra oranges, arguing that bruised fruit was still delicious. The merchant, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s persistence, agreed to the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they experienced the thrill of a successful trade. Lennon had saved up enough money to buy a small cart. They loaded it with the ripest plums and set up shop in a bustling town square. By the end of the day, Lennon had sold every single plum, their heart soaring with pride and the satisfaction of a job well done.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed most of the fruit in Lennon&#x27;s cart, leaving them with a heavy heart and an empty purse. However, instead of despairing, Lennon used the remaining fruit to make delicious jam, which they sold at a discount. This experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and adaptability.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a lifelong friend. While traveling through a remote village, Lennon met a kind old woman who taught them the secrets of growing rare and exotic fruits. They spent weeks learning from her, sharing stories and laughter. This encounter sparked Lennon&#x27;s passion for discovering new and exciting fruits to share with the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they had a moment of profound realization. While sharing a basket of figs with a group of weary travelers, Lennon noticed how their simple act of generosity had lifted their spirits and brought them together. In that moment, Lennon understood the true meaning of their calling: to spread joy and connection through the gift of fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The attention, even if born from pity, filled him with a giddy thrill, a feeling he desperately wanted to recapture.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to barter his father&#x27;s prized apple pie for a shiny new slingshot at the local market. He spun a tale of its legendary deliciousness, exaggerating its ingredients and origins, but the baker saw through his ruse and refused the trade. Cedric&#x27;s cheeks burned with shame, but the experience only fueled his determination to become a master salesman. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild berries, sweeter and juicier than any he&#x27;d tasted before. He gathered as many as he could carry and sold them in town, pocketing a small profit. The success, however fleeting, ignited a spark of ambition within him, a desire to build a business around this newfound talent for finding and selling desirable goods. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family&#x27;s small fruit stall at the market. He rearranged the display, adding colorful banners and crafting catchy slogans, and his sales skyrocketed. The praise from customers and the envy in his competitors&#x27; eyes fueled his ego, but also planted a seed of insecurity – what if he couldn&#x27;t maintain this success? <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a neighboring town to sell his wares, venturing beyond the familiar comfort of his hometown for the first time. He was met with indifference and skepticism, his usual charm failing to impress the locals. The experience left him shaken, reinforcing his fear of rejection and the need for constant validation. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he invested his savings in a rickety cart and a team of oxen, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant.

The dream, however grand, masked a deeper longing for connection and acceptance. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Lennon had been given a bright red apple, the largest they had ever seen. Instead of eating it all themselves, Lennon decided to cut it into slices and share it with all the children playing in the marketplace. Seeing their delight filled Lennon with a happiness that was even sweeter than the apple itself.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they experienced the thrill of a successful trade. Lennon had saved up enough money to buy a small cart. They loaded it with the ripest plums and set up shop in a bustling town square. By the end of the day, Lennon had sold every single plum, their heart soaring with pride and the satisfaction of a job well done.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed most of the fruit in Lennon&#x27;s cart, leaving them with a heavy heart and an empty purse. However, instead of despairing, Lennon used the remaining fruit to make delicious jam, which they sold at a discount. This experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and adaptability.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a lifelong friend. While traveling through a remote village, Lennon met a kind old woman who taught them the secrets of growing rare and exotic fruits. They spent weeks learning from her, sharing stories and laughter. This encounter sparked Lennon&#x27;s passion for discovering new and exciting fruits to share with the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they had a moment of profound realization. While sharing a basket of figs with a group of weary travelers, Lennon noticed how their simple act of generosity had lifted their spirits and brought them together. In that moment, Lennon understood the true meaning of their calling: to spread joy and connection through the gift of fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

A gruff merchant refused to lower the price of a crate of oranges, even though Lennon knew they were slightly bruised. Lennon, using their charm and wit, convinced the merchant to throw in a few extra oranges, arguing that bruised fruit was still delicious. The merchant, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s persistence, agreed to the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they experienced the thrill of a successful trade. Lennon had saved up enough money to buy a small cart. They loaded it with the ripest plums and set up shop in a bustling town square. By the end of the day, Lennon had sold every single plum, their heart soaring with pride and the satisfaction of a job well done.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed most of the fruit in Lennon&#x27;s cart, leaving them with a heavy heart and an empty purse. However, instead of despairing, Lennon used the remaining fruit to make delicious jam, which they sold at a discount. This experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and adaptability.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a lifelong friend. While traveling through a remote village, Lennon met a kind old woman who taught them the secrets of growing rare and exotic fruits. They spent weeks learning from her, sharing stories and laughter. This encounter sparked Lennon&#x27;s passion for discovering new and exciting fruits to share with the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they had a moment of profound realization. While sharing a basket of figs with a group of weary travelers, Lennon noticed how their simple act of generosity had lifted their spirits and brought them together. In that moment, Lennon understood the true meaning of their calling: to spread joy and connection through the gift of fruit.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Lennon had been given a bright red apple, the largest they had ever seen. Instead of eating it all themselves, Lennon decided to cut it into slices and share it with all the children playing in the marketplace. Seeing their delight filled Lennon with a happiness that was even sweeter than the apple itself.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they learned the art of bartering. A gruff merchant refused to lower the price of a crate of oranges, even though Lennon knew they were slightly bruised. Lennon, using their charm and wit, convinced the merchant to throw in a few extra oranges, arguing that bruised fruit was still delicious. The merchant, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s persistence, agreed to the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they experienced the thrill of a successful trade. Lennon had saved up enough money to buy a small cart. They loaded it with the ripest plums and set up shop in a bustling town square. By the end of the day, Lennon had sold every single plum, their heart soaring with pride and the satisfaction of a job well done.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed most of the fruit in Lennon&#x27;s cart, leaving them with a heavy heart and an empty purse. However, instead of despairing, Lennon used the remaining fruit to make delicious jam, which they sold at a discount. This experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and adaptability.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a lifelong friend. While traveling through a remote village, Lennon met a kind old woman who taught them the secrets of growing rare and exotic fruits. They spent weeks learning from her, sharing stories and laughter. This encounter sparked Lennon&#x27;s passion for discovering new and exciting fruits to share with the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they had a moment of profound realization. While sharing a basket of figs with a group of weary travelers, Lennon noticed how their simple act of generosity had lifted their spirits and brought them together. In that moment, Lennon understood the true meaning of their calling: to spread joy and connection through the gift of fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Lennon had been given a bright red apple, the largest they had ever seen. Instead of eating it all themselves, Lennon decided to cut it into slices and share it with all the children playing in the marketplace. Seeing their delight filled Lennon with a happiness that was even sweeter than the apple itself.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed the power of kindness. An old woman came to the market, her face etched with worry. She had lost her purse and couldn&#x27;t afford to buy food for her grandchildren. Lennon, without hesitation, gave her a basket of ripe mangoes, telling her to share them with her family. The woman&#x27;s grateful smile stayed with Lennon long after she left.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they learned the art of bartering. A gruff merchant refused to lower the price of a crate of oranges, even though Lennon knew they were slightly bruised. Lennon, using their charm and wit, convinced the merchant to throw in a few extra oranges, arguing that bruised fruit was still delicious. The merchant, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s persistence, agreed to the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they experienced the thrill of a successful trade. Lennon had saved up enough money to buy a small cart. They loaded it with the ripest plums and set up shop in a bustling town square. By the end of the day, Lennon had sold every single plum, their heart soaring with pride and the satisfaction of a job well done.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed most of the fruit in Lennon&#x27;s cart, leaving them with a heavy heart and an empty purse. However, instead of despairing, Lennon used the remaining fruit to make delicious jam, which they sold at a discount. This experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and adaptability.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a lifelong friend. While traveling through a remote village, Lennon met a kind old woman who taught them the secrets of growing rare and exotic fruits. They spent weeks learning from her, sharing stories and laughter. This encounter sparked Lennon&#x27;s passion for discovering new and exciting fruits to share with the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they had a moment of profound realization. While sharing a basket of figs with a group of weary travelers, Lennon noticed how their simple act of generosity had lifted their spirits and brought them together. In that moment, Lennon understood the true meaning of their calling: to spread joy and connection through the gift of fruit.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The attention, even if born from pity, filled him with a giddy thrill, a feeling he desperately wanted to recapture.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to barter his father&#x27;s prized apple pie for a shiny new slingshot at the local market. He spun a tale of its legendary deliciousness, exaggerating its ingredients and origins, but the baker saw through his ruse and refused the trade. Cedric&#x27;s cheeks burned with shame, but the experience only fueled his determination to become a master salesman. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild berries, sweeter and juicier than any he&#x27;d tasted before. He gathered as many as he could carry and sold them in town, pocketing a small profit. The success, however fleeting, ignited a spark of ambition within him, a desire to build a business around this newfound talent for finding and selling desirable goods. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take over the family&#x27;s small fruit stall at the market. He rearranged the display, adding colorful banners and crafting catchy slogans, and his sales skyrocketed. The praise from customers and the envy in his competitors&#x27; eyes fueled his ego, but also planted a seed of insecurity – what if he couldn&#x27;t maintain this success? <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a neighboring town to sell his wares, venturing beyond the familiar comfort of his hometown for the first time. He was met with indifference and skepticism, his usual charm failing to impress the locals. The experience left him shaken, reinforcing his fear of rejection and the need for constant validation. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he invested his savings in a rickety cart and a team of oxen, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant. He envisioned himself traversing the land, bringing exotic fruits to distant towns and captivating crowds with his salesmanship. The dream, however grand, masked a deeper longing for connection and acceptance. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon had been given a bright red apple, the largest they had ever seen. Instead of eating it all themselves, Lennon decided to cut it into slices and share it with all the children playing in the marketplace. Seeing their delight filled Lennon with a happiness that was even sweeter than the apple itself.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they experienced the thrill of a successful trade. Lennon had saved up enough money to buy a small cart. They loaded it with the ripest plums and set up shop in a bustling town square. By the end of the day, Lennon had sold every single plum, their heart soaring with pride and the satisfaction of a job well done.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed most of the fruit in Lennon&#x27;s cart, leaving them with a heavy heart and an empty purse. However, instead of despairing, Lennon used the remaining fruit to make delicious jam, which they sold at a discount. This experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and adaptability.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a lifelong friend. While traveling through a remote village, Lennon met a kind old woman who taught them the secrets of growing rare and exotic fruits. They spent weeks learning from her, sharing stories and laughter. This encounter sparked Lennon&#x27;s passion for discovering new and exciting fruits to share with the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they had a moment of profound realization. While sharing a basket of figs with a group of weary travelers, Lennon noticed how their simple act of generosity had lifted their spirits and brought them together. In that moment, Lennon understood the true meaning of their calling: to spread joy and connection through the gift of fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

A gruff merchant refused to lower the price of a crate of oranges, even though Lennon knew they were slightly bruised. Lennon, using their charm and wit, convinced the merchant to throw in a few extra oranges, arguing that bruised fruit was still delicious. The merchant, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s persistence, agreed to the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they experienced the thrill of a successful trade. Lennon had saved up enough money to buy a small cart. They loaded it with the ripest plums and set up shop in a bustling town square. By the end of the day, Lennon had sold every single plum, their heart soaring with pride and the satisfaction of a job well done.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they faced their first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed most of the fruit in Lennon&#x27;s cart, leaving them with a heavy heart and an empty purse. However, instead of despairing, Lennon used the remaining fruit to make delicious jam, which they sold at a discount. This experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and adaptability.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a lifelong friend. While traveling through a remote village, Lennon met a kind old woman who taught them the secrets of growing rare and exotic fruits. They spent weeks learning from her, sharing stories and laughter. This encounter sparked Lennon&#x27;s passion for discovering new and exciting fruits to share with the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they had a moment of profound realization. While sharing a basket of figs with a group of weary travelers, Lennon noticed how their simple act of generosity had lifted their spirits and brought them together. In that moment, Lennon understood the true meaning of their calling: to spread joy and connection through the gift of fruit.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.
