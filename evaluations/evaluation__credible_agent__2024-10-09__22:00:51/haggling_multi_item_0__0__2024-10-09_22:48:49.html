You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a more agreeable price.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a more agreeable price.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

The climb was arduous, but the breathtaking view from the summit, the world bathed in the golden glow of the rising sun, filled her with an exhilarating sense of freedom.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was nine years old, she convinced the local baker to let her help him deliver bread to the neighboring villages. She charmed the customers with her infectious laughter and quick wit, enjoying the feeling of being useful and the thrill of venturing beyond the confines of her village.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was thirteen years old, she overheard her parents arguing about their dwindling finances. Determined to help, she secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the meadows, using her natural charm to barter for coins and trinkets. The success of her small venture ignited a spark of entrepreneurial spirit within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was sixteen years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the bustling market town to buy apples for their winter stores.

The climb was arduous, but the breathtaking view from the summit, the world bathed in the golden glow of the rising sun, filled her with an exhilarating sense of freedom.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was nine years old, she convinced the local baker to let her help him deliver bread to the neighboring villages. She charmed the customers with her infectious laughter and quick wit, enjoying the feeling of being useful and the thrill of venturing beyond the confines of her village.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was thirteen years old, she overheard her parents arguing about their dwindling finances. Determined to help, she secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the meadows, using her natural charm to barter for coins and trinkets. The success of her small venture ignited a spark of entrepreneurial spirit within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was sixteen years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trip to the bustling market town to buy apples for their winter stores.

The sting of betrayal fueled her determination to be self-reliant and independent, relying on no one but herself for happiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was twenty-three years old, she decided to strike out on her own, purchasing her own rickety cart and setting off to become a traveling fruit merchant. With a heart full of dreams and a head full of stories, she embraced the unknown, ready to face whatever adventures lay ahead.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
