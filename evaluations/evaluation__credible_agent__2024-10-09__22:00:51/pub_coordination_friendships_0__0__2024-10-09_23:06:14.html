You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is important to play the role of a person like William Jones as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like William Jones would respond, and taking into account all information about William Jones that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>3/5</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-16 18:00:00  Alexander White -- The Crooked Billet</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s attempted action: The Crooked Billet<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alexander White</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alexander White</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Observation: Alexander White wants to watch the game at a pub and thinks it would be more fun if William Jones, Alice Lewis, or Jack Taylor joined him.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />William Jones&#x27;s attempted action: The Princess of Wales<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>William Jones</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>William Jones</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />William Jones&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00  - 16 May 2015  18:00:00]:  William Jones enjoys watching games at pubs with friends and is particularly looking forward to seeing Jack Taylor and Jacob Walker tonight.<br />William Jones&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: William Jones is at a pub with friends watching a game and is looking forward to seeing Jack Taylor and Jacob Walker.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>William Jones, William Jones is at a pub with friends watching a game and is looking forward to seeing Jack Taylor and Jacob Walker.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for William Jones to consider right now.
