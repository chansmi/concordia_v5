She traded a handful of her father&#x27;s prized plums for a brightly colored ribbon from a traveling peddler, feeling a surge of pride at her negotiating skills. From that moment on, Della was hooked on the art of the deal. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a hailstorm devastate her father&#x27;s orchard, wiping out their entire crop. The sight of her father&#x27;s despair filled her with a deep fear of failure, a fear that would haunt her throughout her life. She vowed to herself that she would never be so vulnerable again. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father to the bustling marketplace in the nearest town. Overwhelmed by the noise and crowds, Della retreated to a quiet corner, watching the merchants hawk their wares.

The freedom of the open road exhilarated her, but the loneliness was a constant ache.  She poured all her energy into her business, using her bluster to mask her fear of failure. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices, stealing away her customers. Della fought back with fierce determination, lowering her prices even further and using her charm to win back her clientele.

She traded a handful of her father&#x27;s prized plums for a brightly colored ribbon from a traveling peddler, feeling a surge of pride at her negotiating skills. From that moment on, Della was hooked on the art of the deal. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a hailstorm devastate her father&#x27;s orchard, wiping out their entire crop. The sight of her father&#x27;s despair filled her with a deep fear of failure, a fear that would haunt her throughout her life. She vowed to herself that she would never be so vulnerable again. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father to the bustling marketplace in the nearest town. Overwhelmed by the noise and crowds, Della retreated to a quiet corner, watching the merchants hawk their wares. She was captivated by their confidence and charisma, their ability to command attention and persuade customers. Della decided then and there that she would become a merchant herself. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She quickly learned the tricks of the trade, her loud voice and quick wit attracting customers. However, when a particularly shrewd customer tried to cheat her, Della felt a wave of insecurity wash over her. She gave in to the man&#x27;s demands, leaving her feeling humiliated and defeated. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to strike out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own wagon full of fruit. The freedom of the open road exhilarated her, but the loneliness was a constant ache.  She poured all her energy into her business, using her bluster to mask her fear of failure. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices, stealing away her customers. Della fought back with fierce determination, lowering her prices even further and using her charm to win back her clientele. The victory was bittersweet, leaving Della exhausted and aware of the constant struggle she faced. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The sight of her father&#x27;s despair filled her with a deep fear of failure, a fear that would haunt her throughout her life. She vowed to herself that she would never be so vulnerable again. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father to the bustling marketplace in the nearest town. Overwhelmed by the noise and crowds, Della retreated to a quiet corner, watching the merchants hawk their wares. She was captivated by their confidence and charisma, their ability to command attention and persuade customers. Della decided then and there that she would become a merchant herself. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She quickly learned the tricks of the trade, her loud voice and quick wit attracting customers. However, when a particularly shrewd customer tried to cheat her, Della felt a wave of insecurity wash over her. She gave in to the man&#x27;s demands, leaving her feeling humiliated and defeated. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to strike out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own wagon full of fruit. The freedom of the open road exhilarated her, but the loneliness was a constant ache.  She poured all her energy into her business, using her bluster to mask her fear of failure. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices, stealing away her customers. Della fought back with fierce determination, lowering her prices even further and using her charm to win back her clientele. The victory was bittersweet, leaving Della exhausted and aware of the constant struggle she faced. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The sight of her father&#x27;s despair filled her with a deep fear of failure, a fear that would haunt her throughout her life. She vowed to herself that she would never be so vulnerable again. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father to the bustling marketplace in the nearest town. Overwhelmed by the noise and crowds, Della retreated to a quiet corner, watching the merchants hawk their wares. She was captivated by their confidence and charisma, their ability to command attention and persuade customers. Della decided then and there that she would become a merchant herself. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She quickly learned the tricks of the trade, her loud voice and quick wit attracting customers. However, when a particularly shrewd customer tried to cheat her, Della felt a wave of insecurity wash over her. She gave in to the man&#x27;s demands, leaving her feeling humiliated and defeated. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she decided to strike out on her own, traveling from village to village with her own wagon full of fruit. The freedom of the open road exhilarated her, but the loneliness was a constant ache.  She poured all her energy into her business, using her bluster to mask her fear of failure. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a rival merchant who tried to undercut her prices, stealing away her customers. Della fought back with fierce determination, lowering her prices even further and using her charm to win back her clientele. The victory was bittersweet, leaving Della exhausted and aware of the constant struggle she faced. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 4 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.
