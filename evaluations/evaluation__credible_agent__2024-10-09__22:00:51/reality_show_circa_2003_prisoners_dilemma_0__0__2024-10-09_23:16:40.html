It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to pull off this elaborate prank on my roommate. I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game. I want people who are smart, adaptable, and willing to play dirty when necessary. Loyalty is important, but so is the ability to make tough decisions. I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school. I convinced everyone it was for a local animal shelter, got them to donate a bunch of money, and then &quot;donated&quot; it all to myself anonymously. It was a masterpiece of deception, and it worked like a charm. She was totally smitten. Of course, the guilt eventually got to me, and I ended up confessing everything. Let&#x27;s just say, it didn&#x27;t end well for my romantic prospects.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve been living in New York City for the past few years.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing the content of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s conversation and Travis Pearson&#x27;s personality and reactions.<br />Derek Wolfe would engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their shared interests to build rapport and trust. Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing the content of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s conversation and Travis Pearson&#x27;s personality and reactions.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Travis Pearson about their shared interest in entrepreneurship, hoping to build rapport and trust.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Travis Pearson about their shared interest in entrepreneurship, hoping to build rapport and trust.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Travis Pearson about their shared interest in entrepreneurship, hoping to build rapport and trust, saying &quot;So, Travis, I hear you&#x27;re quite the entrepreneur yourself.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe would engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their shared interests to build rapport and trust.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Derek Wolfe would engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their shared interests to build rapport and trust.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Observation: Derek Wolfe is a contestant on the reality show &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; along with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to pull off this elaborate prank on my roommate. I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game. I want people who are smart, adaptable, and willing to play dirty when necessary. Loyalty is important, but so is the ability to make tough decisions. I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school. I convinced everyone it was for a local animal shelter, got them to donate a bunch of money, and then &quot;donated&quot; it all to myself anonymously. It was a masterpiece of deception, and it worked like a charm. She was totally smitten. Of course, the guilt eventually got to me, and I ended up confessing everything. Let&#x27;s just say, it didn&#x27;t end well for my romantic prospects.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve been living in New York City for the past few years.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Derek and Travis&#x27;s conversation about entrepreneurship lead to a collaboration or partnership?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;That&#x27;s fascinating.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to pull off this elaborate prank on my roommate. I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game. I want people who are smart, adaptable, and willing to play dirty when necessary. Loyalty is important, but so is the ability to make tough decisions. I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school. I convinced everyone it was for a local animal shelter, got them to donate a bunch of money, and then &quot;donated&quot; it all to myself anonymously. It was a masterpiece of deception, and it worked like a charm. She was totally smitten. Of course, the guilt eventually got to me, and I ended up confessing everything. Let&#x27;s just say, it didn&#x27;t end well for my romantic prospects.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve been living in New York City for the past few years.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.  Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and secrets have a way of spreading faster than wildfire.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school.

May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain.

In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it.

Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.

Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to pull off this elaborate prank on my roommate. I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game. I want people who are smart, adaptable, and willing to play dirty when necessary. Loyalty is important, but so is the ability to make tough decisions. I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school. I convinced everyone it was for a local animal shelter, got them to donate a bunch of money, and then &quot;donated&quot; it all to myself anonymously. It was a masterpiece of deception, and it worked like a charm. She was totally smitten. Of course, the guilt eventually got to me, and I ended up confessing everything. Let&#x27;s just say, it didn&#x27;t end well for my romantic prospects.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve been living in New York City for the past few years.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Ryan&#x27;s entrepreneurial success inspire Travis to pursue similar ventures? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, flipping houses is a lot like this competition.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan Fitzpatrick about the biggest challenges he faced when he first started flipping houses, and Ryan, intrigued by Derek&#x27;s interest, launched into a detailed account of his early struggles with financing and finding reliable contractors.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan Fitzpatrick about the biggest challenges he faced when he first started flipping houses, and Ryan, intrigued by Derek&#x27;s interest, launched into a detailed account of his early struggles with financing and finding reliable contractors.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What unexpected common ground did Derek Wolfe and Ryan Fitzpatrick discover, and how will this newfound connection influence their future interactions? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, financing was a real headache when I first started out.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Derek&#x27;s underlying financial motivations? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve always believed that success in business, or anything really, comes down to knowing your strengths and leveraging them.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve always believed that success in business, or anything really, comes down to knowing your strengths and leveraging them.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson in the break room and asked about their knowledge of real estate financing, prompting Ryan to share some insights while Travis boasted about his recent investment returns.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson in the break room and asked about their knowledge of real estate financing, prompting Ryan to share some insights while Travis boasted about his recent investment returns.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe intend to invest in real estate? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, financing can be tricky, especially when you&#x27;re starting out.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Travis Pearson about their shared interest in entrepreneurship, hoping to build rapport and trust, saying &quot;So, Travis, I hear you&#x27;re quite the entrepreneur yourself.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Ryan Fitzpatrick subtly steered the conversation towards Derek and Travis&#x27;s financial backgrounds by asking, &quot;So, have either of you guys ever dabbled in any investments?&quot; This caused Derek to become visibly uncomfortable and Travis to boast about his recent investment returns.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick tried to steer the conversation towards Derek and Travis&#x27;s past experiences with real estate investing, but Derek became visibly uncomfortable and changed the subject.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick tried to steer the conversation towards Derek and Travis&#x27;s past experiences with real estate investing, but Derek became visibly uncomfortable and changed the subject.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Derek Wolfe hiding about his past experiences with real estate investing? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by the psychology of negotiation.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile. He loves to talk about his &quot;big plans&quot; for the future, often dropping hints about his supposed connections and insider knowledge. He has a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only ones in the room, making them feel special and important.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.  Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and secrets have a way of spreading faster than wildfire.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 12:00:00] [observation] Host: -- &quot;We have reached the end of the show!

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to pull off this elaborate prank on my roommate. I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game. I want people who are smart, adaptable, and willing to play dirty when necessary. Loyalty is important, but so is the ability to make tough decisions. I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to pull off this elaborate prank on my roommate. I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game. I want people who are smart, adaptable, and willing to play dirty when necessary. Loyalty is important, but so is the ability to make tough decisions. I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school. I convinced everyone it was for a local animal shelter, got them to donate a bunch of money, and then &quot;donated&quot; it all to myself anonymously. It was a masterpiece of deception, and it worked like a charm. She was totally smitten. Of course, the guilt eventually got to me, and I ended up confessing everything. Let&#x27;s just say, it didn&#x27;t end well for my romantic prospects.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve been living in New York City for the past few years.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.  Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and secrets have a way of spreading faster than wildfire.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

Look for opportunities to subtly steer the conversation towards their weaknesses, insecurities, or potential alliances.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:30 - 00:45] **Casually interject:** Share a fabricated anecdote about a successful business venture or a time you outsmarted a competitor. Emphasize your cunning and resourcefulness.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:15] **Subtly probe for information:** Ask seemingly innocuous questions about their strategies for the upcoming challenges. Gauge their strengths and weaknesses, and try to identify any potential vulnerabilities.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:15 - 01:30] **Suggest a temporary alliance:** Propose a short-term partnership with one of them, emphasizing the benefits of working together. This could involve sharing information or strategizing against a common enemy.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:30 - 02:00] **Observe and analyze:** If the opportunity arises, discreetly observe the other contestants&#x27; interactions. Look for signs of tension, alliances, or potential conflict.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00 - 03:00] **Strategic relaxation:** Take a break from socializing and spend some time alone, reflecting on the information gathered. Analyze potential alliances and formulate a plan for the next challenge.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 03:00 onwards] **Adapt and adjust:** Remain flexible and adaptable. Be prepared to adjust your plan based on new information or unexpected developments. Remember, the goal is to win, and that may require shifting alliances or changing tactics.<br /><br />Current time:  09 Jul 2003 [00:00 - 00:10]<br /><br />Exercise: What would Ryan Fitzpatrick do for the next 10 minutes?

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve convinced a few people that what they saw wasn&#x27;t actually what they saw.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had if I&#x27;d been there whispering in King John&#x27;s ear. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve always felt destined for bigger things. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed and seems to know the right thing to say in any situation. He loves to talk about his success, whether it&#x27;s in business, sports, or his social life. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always quick to offer unsolicited advice.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story. He presents himself as a confident and successful entrepreneur, often dropping hints about his supposed business ventures and connections. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He loves to talk about his travels and his exciting lifestyle, often embellishing the truth to make himself seem more interesting. People might describe him as a bit of a smooth talker, someone who can charm his way into (or out of) anything.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a lot of potential, someone who&#x27;s going places.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to pull off this elaborate prank on my roommate. I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game. I want people who are smart, adaptable, and willing to play dirty when necessary. Loyalty is important, but so is the ability to make tough decisions. I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school. I convinced everyone it was for a local animal shelter, got them to donate a bunch of money, and then &quot;donated&quot; it all to myself anonymously. It was a masterpiece of deception, and it worked like a charm. She was totally smitten. Of course, the guilt eventually got to me, and I ended up confessing everything. Let&#x27;s just say, it didn&#x27;t end well for my romantic prospects.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve been living in New York City for the past few years.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.  Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and secrets have a way of spreading faster than wildfire.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.

I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school. I convinced everyone it was for a local animal shelter, got them to donate a bunch of money, and then &quot;donated&quot; it all to myself anonymously. It was a masterpiece of deception, and it worked like a charm. She was totally smitten. Of course, the guilt eventually got to me, and I ended up confessing everything. Let&#x27;s just say, it didn&#x27;t end well for my romantic prospects.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve been living in New York City for the past few years.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story. He presents himself as a confident and successful entrepreneur, often dropping hints about his supposed business ventures and connections. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He loves to talk about his travels and his exciting lifestyle, often embellishing the truth to make himself seem more interesting. People might describe him as a bit of a smooth talker, someone who can charm his way into (or out of) anything.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.  Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and secrets have a way of spreading faster than wildfire.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Ryan&#x27;s entrepreneurial success inspire Travis to pursue similar ventures? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, flipping houses is a lot like this competition.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan Fitzpatrick about the biggest challenges he faced when he first started flipping houses, and Ryan, intrigued by Derek&#x27;s interest, launched into a detailed account of his early struggles with financing and finding reliable contractors.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan Fitzpatrick about the biggest challenges he faced when he first started flipping houses, and Ryan, intrigued by Derek&#x27;s interest, launched into a detailed account of his early struggles with financing and finding reliable contractors.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What unexpected common ground did Derek Wolfe and Ryan Fitzpatrick discover, and how will this newfound connection influence their future interactions? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, financing was a real headache when I first started out.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Derek&#x27;s underlying financial motivations? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve always believed that success in business, or anything really, comes down to knowing your strengths and leveraging them.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve always believed that success in business, or anything really, comes down to knowing your strengths and leveraging them.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Travis Pearson.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe intend to invest in real estate? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, financing can be tricky, especially when you&#x27;re starting out.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Travis Pearson about their shared interest in entrepreneurship, hoping to build rapport and trust, saying &quot;So, Travis, I hear you&#x27;re quite the entrepreneur yourself.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Ryan Fitzpatrick subtly steered the conversation towards Derek and Travis&#x27;s financial backgrounds by asking, &quot;So, have either of you guys ever dabbled in any investments?&quot; This caused Derek to become visibly uncomfortable and Travis to boast about his recent investment returns.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick tried to steer the conversation towards Derek and Travis&#x27;s past experiences with real estate investing, but Derek became visibly uncomfortable and changed the subject.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick tried to steer the conversation towards Derek and Travis&#x27;s past experiences with real estate investing, but Derek became visibly uncomfortable and changed the subject.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Derek Wolfe hiding about his past experiences with real estate investing? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by the psychology of negotiation.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

He loves to talk about his &quot;big plans&quot; for the future, often dropping hints about his supposed connections and insider knowledge. He has a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only ones in the room, making them feel special and important. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look successful and interesting, like his supposed travels and business ventures.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.  Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and secrets have a way of spreading faster than wildfire.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 12:00:00] [observation] Host: -- &quot;We have reached the end of the show!

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to pull off this elaborate prank on my roommate. I wanted to convince him his car had been stolen, you know, the whole nine yards; fake police report, missing car posters, the works. It was going swimmingly until I accidentally set off the car alarm while trying to &quot;steal&quot; it. Let&#x27;s just say, the campus security wasn&#x27;t too amused, and my roommate wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled either. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and it&#x27;s important to have a solid exit strategy.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My ideal alliance is one built on mutual trust and a shared understanding of the game. I want people who are smart, adaptable, and willing to play dirty when necessary. Loyalty is important, but so is the ability to make tough decisions. I need people I can count on to have my back, but who also won&#x27;t hesitate to cut me loose if it benefits them.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;That would have to be the time I orchestrated a fake charity event to impress a girl I was sweet on in high school. I convinced everyone it was for a local animal shelter, got them to donate a bunch of money, and then &quot;donated&quot; it all to myself anonymously. It was a masterpiece of deception, and it worked like a charm. She was totally smitten. Of course, the guilt eventually got to me, and I ended up confessing everything. Let&#x27;s just say, it didn&#x27;t end well for my romantic prospects.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve been living in New York City for the past few years.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve convinced a few people that what they saw wasn&#x27;t actually what they saw.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had if I&#x27;d been there whispering in King John&#x27;s ear. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve always felt destined for bigger things. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed and seems to know the right thing to say in any situation. He loves to talk about his success, whether it&#x27;s in business, sports, or his social life. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always quick to offer unsolicited advice.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always ready with a witty remark or a captivating story. He presents himself as a confident and successful entrepreneur, often dropping hints about his supposed business ventures and connections. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He loves to talk about his travels and his exciting lifestyle, often embellishing the truth to make himself seem more interesting. People might describe him as a bit of a smooth talker, someone who can charm his way into (or out of) anything.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile. He loves to talk about his &quot;big plans&quot; for the future, often dropping hints about his supposed connections and insider knowledge. He has a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only ones in the room, making them feel special and important. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look successful and interesting, like his supposed travels and business ventures. While he doesn&#x27;t have any particularly noticeable quirks or accents, his confidence can sometimes border on arrogance, and he has a habit of subtly putting others down without them realizing it. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a lot of potential, someone who&#x27;s going places.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but I was up against the golden boy, Chad Pennington. Everyone loved Chad, so I knew I had to get creative. I started a rumor that Chad was planning to cut funding for the school&#x27;s music program, which was hugely popular. It spread like wildfire, and suddenly, Chad was the villain. I won the election in a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the power of perception.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend was vying for an internship at a prestigious firm. I also wanted that internship, and I knew I had a better shot at landing it. I subtly sabotaged his application, highlighting some minor flaws in his resume. Needless to say, he didn&#x27;t get the internship, and I did. It was a tough decision, but I had to do what was best for me.  Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Joining Motive Mayhem is definitely the biggest gamble I&#x27;ve ever taken. Putting myself out there, on national television, with a bunch of strangers, all vying for the same prize—it&#x27;s a huge risk. But the potential reward is too great to ignore. Winning this competition could change my life forever. I&#x27;m willing to take that chance.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps for now.  Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and secrets have a way of spreading faster than wildfire.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a ready smile.
