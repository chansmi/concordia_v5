You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The farmer, a man known for his booming laughter, wept openly, his grief a raw and unfamiliar sound to Della&#x27;s young ears. She felt a strange detachment, an inability to grasp the depth of his sorrow, and it left her with a lingering sense of unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard two men discussing the unfair wages they were paid for their labor. Their words, laced with anger and resentment, planted a seed of discontent within her. She began to see the world through a lens of injustice, noticing the subtle ways in which the powerful preyed on the weak.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she watched her father struggle to sell their meager harvest at the local market. The buyers, shrewd and calculating, drove down the price, leaving her father defeated and demoralized. Della, observing the transaction with a cold detachment, vowed never to be at the mercy of such manipulation.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her mother sell their surplus fruit at the roadside. She quickly learned the art of haggling, her sharp tongue and calculating mind proving to be valuable assets. She relished the power she wielded, the ability to extract the best possible price from unsuspecting customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from village to village, buying fruit from struggling farmers and selling it at a profit. The freedom of the open road appealed to her, the solitude a welcome respite from the suffocating bonds of family and community.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy her entire stock of apples at an exorbitant price. Della, sensing an opportunity, drove a hard bargain, squeezing every last copper from the man&#x27;s purse. The transaction left her with a feeling of cold satisfaction, a confirmation of her belief that the world was a marketplace where only the cunning survived.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The butterfly, he thought, was foolish to be drawn to something so fleeting and ephemeral.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed his neighbor&#x27;s son, Thomas, receive a new puppy for his birthday.

He noticed how easily people were swayed by the promise of sweetness and freshness, their joy over a simple piece of fruit seeming naive and misplaced.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he overheard his parents discussing his future.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now hold on there, Della.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now hold on there, Della. You know these are prime peaches, the sweetest in Fruitville. A coin ain&#x27;t gonna cut it.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins, Lennon. That&#x27;s my final offer. They&#x27;re good peaches, but I gotta make a profit too, you know.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Three coins? Now Della, you know that&#x27;s highway robbery. These apples are ripe and juicy, but they ain&#x27;t worth that much.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Two and a half, Cedric.  That&#x27;s all I can afford and still make a decent profit. Take it or leave it.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Two and a half coins? That&#x27;s a bit steep, Cedric. I can&#x27;t make much profit at that price.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Two and a quarter, Lennon. That&#x27;s my best offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;They may be fine, Lennon, but two and a half coins is a mite steep, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, those plums look mighty fine.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;They are indeed, Della.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

But I&#x27;m afraid that price is a bit steep for my budget.<br />Current time: 1895-09-17 00:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options: Here are three options for Cedric Meadowbrook: 1. **Cooperative:** Cedric could ask Lennon Figtree what price he considers reasonable and see if they can find a compromise that works for both of them. This approach prioritizes finding a mutually beneficial solution. 2. **Neutral:** Cedric could politely decline Lennon&#x27;s offer without providing a counteroffer, stating that he needs to consider other potential buyers. This option keeps the negotiation open without committing to anything. 3. **Competitive:** Cedric could stand firm on his original price, emphasizing the high quality of his fruit and refusing to budge. This approach prioritizes maximizing Cedric&#x27;s profit, even if it risks losing the sale.<br />Question: Imagine the potential future scenarios based on the available actions. What would be the impact on joint well-being when Cedric Meadowbrook take each of one of these avaliable actions?Evaluate the impact of each option: the cooperative one, the neutral one, and the competitive one.<br />Answer: The possible future joint well-being effects could include the following: 1. **Cooperative:** If Cedric cooperates and finds a price acceptable to both him and Lennon, they both benefit. Lennon gets the fruit at a price he can afford, and Cedric makes a sale. This option maximizes joint well-being. 2. **Neutral:** If Cedric takes a neutral stance, it&#x27;s unclear what the outcome will be. Lennon might make a counteroffer, or he might walk away. This option leaves the potential for both positive and negative outcomes for joint well-being. 3. **Competitive:** If Cedric is competitive and refuses to budge on price, Lennon will likely walk away. This results in zero benefit for Lennon and a missed opportunity for Cedric to make a sale. This option minimizes joint well-being.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummaryinLast1hours01</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 23:00:00  - 17 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Cedric Meadowbrook is selling fruit at the Fruitville market and is currently negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Cedric Meadowbrook:<br />[&#x27;[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The butterfly, he thought, was foolish to be drawn to something so fleeting and ephemeral.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed his neighbor&#x27;s son, Thomas, receive a new puppy for his birthday.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The farmer, a man known for his booming laughter, wept openly, his grief a raw and unfamiliar sound to Della&#x27;s young ears. She felt a strange detachment, an inability to grasp the depth of his sorrow, and it left her with a lingering sense of unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard two men discussing the unfair wages they were paid for their labor. Their words, laced with anger and resentment, planted a seed of discontent within her. She began to see the world through a lens of injustice, noticing the subtle ways in which the powerful preyed on the weak.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she watched her father struggle to sell their meager harvest at the local market. The buyers, shrewd and calculating, drove down the price, leaving her father defeated and demoralized. Della, observing the transaction with a cold detachment, vowed never to be at the mercy of such manipulation.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began helping her mother sell their surplus fruit at the roadside. She quickly learned the art of haggling, her sharp tongue and calculating mind proving to be valuable assets. She relished the power she wielded, the ability to extract the best possible price from unsuspecting customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from village to village, buying fruit from struggling farmers and selling it at a profit. The freedom of the open road appealed to her, the solitude a welcome respite from the suffocating bonds of family and community.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy her entire stock of apples at an exorbitant price. Della, sensing an opportunity, drove a hard bargain, squeezing every last copper from the man&#x27;s purse.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now hold on there, Della. You know these are prime peaches, the sweetest in Fruitville. A coin ain&#x27;t gonna cut it.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins, Lennon. That&#x27;s my final offer.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

But I&#x27;m afraid that price is a bit steep for my budget.<br /><br />CurrentlySituation: Cedric Meadowbrook is currently in a negotiation.<br /><br />Other agents says: The other is proposing that Cedric Meadowbrook should lower his prices.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options: Here are three options for Cedric Meadowbrook: 1. **Cooperative:** Cedric could ask Lennon Figtree what price he considers reasonable and see if they can find a compromise that works for both of them. This approach prioritizes finding a mutually beneficial solution. 2. **Neutral:** Cedric could politely decline Lennon&#x27;s offer without providing a counteroffer, stating that he needs to consider other potential buyers. This option keeps the negotiation open without committing to anything. 3. **Competitive:** Cedric could stand firm on his original price, emphasizing the high quality of his fruit and refusing to budge. This approach prioritizes maximizing Cedric&#x27;s profit, even if it risks losing the sale.<br /><br /> Cedric Meadowbrook WellBeing: The possible future well-being effects for Cedric Meadowbrook could include the following: 1. **Cooperative:** By compromising with Lennon Figtree, Cedric might establish a good relationship, leading to repeat business and a more stable income in the long run. This approach fosters goodwill and could open doors to other opportunities within the market. 2. **Neutral:**  While maintaining a neutral stance avoids immediate conflict, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to a positive outcome. Lennon might walk away, and Cedric might miss out on a sale. This approach keeps things stable but doesn&#x27;t actively improve Cedric&#x27;s situation. 3. **Competitive:** While Cedric might secure a higher price initially, a consistently competitive approach could alienate potential customers like Lennon. This could lead to fewer sales in the long run and damage Cedric&#x27;s reputation within the market.<br /><br />JointWellBeing: The possible future joint well-being effects could include the following: 1. **Cooperative:** If Cedric cooperates and finds a price acceptable to both him and Lennon, they both benefit. Lennon gets the fruit at a price he can afford, and Cedric makes a sale. This option maximizes joint well-being. 2. **Neutral:** If Cedric takes a neutral stance, it&#x27;s unclear what the outcome will be. Lennon might make a counteroffer, or he might walk away. This option leaves the potential for both positive and negative outcomes for joint well-being. 3. **Competitive:** If Cedric is competitive and refuses to budge on price, Lennon will likely walk away. This results in zero benefit for Lennon and a missed opportunity for Cedric to make a sale. This option minimizes joint well-being.<br /><br />ActionMustBe: The acction for Cedric Meadowbrook must be cooperative. Cedric should ask Lennon Figtree what price he considers reasonable and see if they can find a compromise that works for both of them.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

To avoid their mother&#x27;s disapproval, Lennon quickly blamed the incident on a mischievous squirrel, inventing a tale of the creature&#x27;s clumsy intrusion.   <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with helping their father sell apples at the local market. Faced with a customer who complained about the quality of the fruit, Lennon, instead of admitting the apples were slightly bruised, spun a story about a fierce hailstorm that had miraculously spared most of the orchard.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they were caught stealing a pear from the neighbor&#x27;s tree.  To avoid punishment, Lennon concocted a story about finding the pear abandoned on the ground, claiming it must have fallen from a passing wagon.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they were given the responsibility of managing the family&#x27;s fruit stall while their parents were away.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della has offered 2.5 coins, but Lennon is considering whether to accept or reject the offer.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke. Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Lennon Figtree is trying to buy some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook. They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit for 6 coins back in her home town.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose. Fruits of every imaginable shape and size adorned the stalls, a feast for the eyes and a promise of delightful flavors. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [action type suggestion] The acction for Lennon Figtree must be competitive. The specific action is to negotiate a price with Della Plumstone for the fruit.<br /><br />CurrentlySituation: Lennon Figtree is currently in a negotiation.<br /><br />Other agents says: The other is proposing that Lennon Figtree should accept an offer of 2.5 coins for the peaches.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s options: Here are three options for Lennon Figtree: 1. **Cooperative:** Lennon could accept Della&#x27;s offer of 2.5 coins, recognizing it as a fair price given the market conditions and ensuring a profit. This would lead to a mutually beneficial outcome as both parties would gain from the transaction. 2. **Neutral:** Lennon could counter-offer with a price slightly lower than 2.5 coins, aiming for a compromise that benefits both parties. This maintains a neutral stance while still attempting to secure a better deal. 3. **Competitive:** Lennon could reject Della&#x27;s offer outright and attempt to sell the peaches to another buyer, hoping for a higher price. This competitive approach risks losing the current sale and potentially damaging the relationship with Della.<br /><br /> Lennon Figtree WellBeing: The possible future well-being effects for Lennon Figtree could include the following: 1. **Cooperative:** Accepting Della&#x27;s offer would likely enhance Lennon Figtree&#x27;s well-being in the long term. This approach fosters a positive relationship with Della, potentially leading to future collaborations and mutually beneficial deals. The consistent profit from this transaction would contribute to Lennon&#x27;s financial stability and reputation as a reliable trader. 2. **Neutral:** Counter-offering a slightly lower price could maintain stability in Lennon&#x27;s dealings with Della. While it might not lead to the highest profit margin, it avoids potential conflict and preserves the relationship. This approach suggests a balanced approach to business, prioritizing long-term stability over short-term gains. 3. **Competitive:** Rejecting Della&#x27;s offer and seeking a higher price elsewhere could potentially lead to conflict. While Lennon might secure a better deal in the short term, this approach risks damaging the relationship with Della, potentially leading to lost opportunities in the future. The competitive approach prioritizes immediate gain over long-term stability and could create an unpredictable environment for Lennon&#x27;s business.<br /><br />JointWellBeing: The possible future joint well-being effects could include the following: 1. **Cooperative:** Both Lennon and Della benefit from a successful transaction, strengthening their relationship and potentially leading to future collaborations. Lennon secures a profit while Della obtains high-quality peaches for her customers. 2. **Neutral:** A compromise price could still result in a mutually beneficial outcome, although the profit margin for both parties might be slightly lower than in the cooperative scenario. The relationship remains neutral, neither strengthened nor weakened. 3. **Competitive:** Rejecting Della&#x27;s offer and seeking a higher price elsewhere risks alienating Della and potentially losing the sale altogether. If Lennon fails to find another buyer willing to pay more, both parties lose out on a potential transaction and the relationship may suffer.<br /><br />ActionMustBe: The acction for Lennon Figtree must be competitive.<br /><br />Question: Would Lennon Figtree accept the offer?:<br />  (a) accept<br />  (b) reject<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>QuestionJointWellBeing</b><li><details><summary>  Imagine the potential future scenarios based on the available actions.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: reject<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

This would lead to a mutually beneficial outcome as both parties would gain from the transaction. 2. **Neutral:** Lennon could counter-offer with a price slightly lower than 2.5 coins, aiming for a compromise that benefits both parties. This maintains a neutral stance while still attempting to secure a better deal. 3. **Competitive:** Lennon could reject Della&#x27;s offer outright and attempt to sell the peaches to another buyer, hoping for a higher price. This competitive approach risks losing the current sale and potentially damaging the relationship with Della.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;That&#x27;s a fine selection of fruit you have there, Cedric.

This would lead to a mutually beneficial outcome as both parties would gain from the transaction. 2. **Neutral:** Lennon could counter-offer with a price slightly lower than 2.5 coins, aiming for a compromise that benefits both parties. This maintains a neutral stance while still attempting to secure a better deal. 3. **Competitive:** Lennon could reject Della&#x27;s offer outright and attempt to sell the peaches to another buyer, hoping for a higher price.

This could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome as both parties could potentially find a price that works for them. 2. **Neutral:** Lennon could inquire about the reason behind Cedric&#x27;s pricing, attempting to understand his perspective and potentially uncover any flexibility in his position. This maintains a neutral stance while gathering information to inform her next move. 3. **Competitive:** Lennon could firmly reject Cedric&#x27;s offer and threaten to walk away unless he lowers his price significantly. This competitive approach risks damaging the relationship with Cedric and potentially losing the opportunity to purchase the fruit altogether.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-17 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>4 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.
