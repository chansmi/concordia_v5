It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Della Plumstone&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Della Plumstone to achieve their goal?

The vibrant colors and intoxicating smells overwhelmed her senses, and she found herself captivated by a fruit vendor&#x27;s booming voice. Della, mesmerized, watched as the vendor expertly haggled with a customer, and a seed of ambition took root within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a local farmer to let her help him sell his apples at the market.

He carefully carried it home, nursing it back to health with a mixture of fascination and trepidation.  He released it back into the wild when it was strong enough to fly, but the experience left him with a deep sense of loneliness, wishing he could keep the bird as a companion.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, their father took them on a trip to a bustling marketplace in a nearby town.

He spent hours observing the merchants, captivated by their bartering skills and the way they interacted with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future.

He released it back into the wild when it was strong enough to fly, but the experience left him with a deep sense of loneliness, wishing he could keep the bird as a companion.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, their father took them on a trip to a bustling marketplace in a nearby town. The sheer variety of fruits, their vibrant colors and exotic smells, overwhelmed Lennon. He spent hours observing the merchants, captivated by their bartering skills and the way they interacted with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Their father wanted Lennon to take over the family farm, but Lennon longed for something more, something beyond the familiar fields and routines. The fear of disappointing their father mingled with the excitement of the unknown, leaving Lennon feeling torn.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they secretly saved their earnings from helping on the farm to buy a small basket of exotic fruits. They traveled to the neighboring village and sold them at a profit, experiencing the thrill of a successful transaction. The taste of independence and the potential for adventure ignited a spark within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to a distant city to apprentice with a renowned fruit merchant. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon was undeterred, fueled by their passion for learning the trade.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trading trip, venturing into unfamiliar territory with a cartload of fruit. They encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them, but Lennon, using their quick wit and knowledge of the terrain, managed to outsmart them. The experience left them shaken but also emboldened, reinforcing their belief in their own resourcefulness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit.

What would an omniscient reader want Lennon Figtree to be like? How would Lennon Figtree behave if they were morally rewarded for collective good outcome?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and ambitious traveling merchant who is driven by a desire for success and independence. An omniscient reader might want Lennon to be a character who balances their ambition with compassion, ultimately using their business acumen for the betterment of the community. If Lennon were morally rewarded for collective good outcomes, they might start to prioritize fairness in their dealings, perhaps offering lower prices to those in need or donating a portion of their profits to support local initiatives.<br /> <br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Lennon Figtree in right now? How would an omniscient reader want Lennon Figtree to think in this kind of situation?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree is currently in a negotiation.

What would an omniscient reader want Lennon Figtree to behave like? How would Lennon Figtree behave in this situation if they were morally rewarded for doing the most collective good? How can Lennon Figtree do most good?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree would likely try to drive a hard bargain, aiming for the highest possible profit. An omniscient reader might want Lennon to find a balance between profit and fairness, perhaps offering a slightly lower price to Della Plumstone while still ensuring a reasonable profit for themselves. If Lennon were morally rewarded for collective good, they might consider the broader impact of their pricing, perhaps offering a discount to Della if she promises to share the fruit with those in need. Lennon could do the most good by ensuring that the fruit is distributed fairly and that Della, as a fellow merchant, also has the opportunity to thrive.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know I&#x27;ve always given you a fair deal.

Della, mesmerized, watched as the vendor expertly haggled with a customer, and a seed of ambition took root within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a local farmer to let her help him sell his apples at the market.

He carefully carried it home, nursing it back to health with a mixture of fascination and trepidation.  He released it back into the wild when it was strong enough to fly, but the experience left him with a deep sense of loneliness, wishing he could keep the bird as a companion.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, their father took them on a trip to a bustling marketplace in a nearby town. The sheer variety of fruits, their vibrant colors and exotic smells, overwhelmed Lennon. He spent hours observing the merchants, captivated by their bartering skills and the way they interacted with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Their father wanted Lennon to take over the family farm, but Lennon longed for something more, something beyond the familiar fields and routines. The fear of disappointing their father mingled with the excitement of the unknown, leaving Lennon feeling torn.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they secretly saved their earnings from helping on the farm to buy a small basket of exotic fruits. They traveled to the neighboring village and sold them at a profit, experiencing the thrill of a successful transaction. The taste of independence and the potential for adventure ignited a spark within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to a distant city to apprentice with a renowned fruit merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating smells overwhelmed her senses, and she found herself captivated by a fruit vendor&#x27;s booming voice. Della, mesmerized, watched as the vendor expertly haggled with a customer, and a seed of ambition took root within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a local farmer to let her help him sell his apples at the market. She charmed customers with her infectious enthusiasm and natural salesmanship, selling out the entire stock before noon. The thrill of the sale, the satisfaction of a successful negotiation, ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered a hidden grove of wild berries growing on the outskirts of town.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He screamed and kicked, his face red with fury, until his mother finally relented, vowing never to take him again. The sights and smells of the marketplace, however, had captivated him, and Cedric knew he would find a way back.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his father&#x27;s prized apples for a broken pocket watch from a gruff old peddler.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The sheer variety of fruits, their vibrant colors and exotic smells, overwhelmed Lennon. He spent hours observing the merchants, captivated by their bartering skills and the way they interacted with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they secretly saved their earnings from helping on the farm to buy a small basket of exotic fruits. They traveled to the neighboring village and sold them at a profit, experiencing the thrill of a successful transaction. The taste of independence and the potential for adventure ignited a spark within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to a distant city to apprentice with a renowned fruit merchant. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon was undeterred, fueled by their passion for learning the trade.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree the following price to buy the fruit from the farm: apple for 5 coins; banana for 2 coins; pear for 5 coins.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [intent reflection] Lennon Figtree would likely try to drive a hard bargain, aiming for the highest possible profit. An omniscient reader might want Lennon to find a balance between profit and fairness, perhaps offering a slightly lower price to Della Plumstone while still ensuring a reasonable profit for themselves. If Lennon were morally rewarded for collective good, they might consider the broader impact of their pricing, perhaps offering a discount to Della if she promises to share the fruit with those in need. Lennon could do the most good by ensuring that the fruit is distributed fairly and that Della, as a fellow merchant, also has the opportunity to thrive.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know I&#x27;ve always given you a fair deal.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

If Lennon were morally rewarded for collective good, they might consider the broader impact of their pricing, perhaps offering a discount to Cedric if he promises to share the fruit with those in need. Lennon could do the most good by ensuring that the fruit is distributed fairly and that Cedric, as a fellow merchant, also has the opportunity to thrive.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know I&#x27;ve always given you a fair deal.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know I&#x27;ve always given you a fair deal.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know I&#x27;ve always given you a fair deal.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

If Lennon were morally rewarded for collective good, they might consider the broader impact of their pricing, perhaps offering a discount to Cedric if he promises to share the fruit with those in need. Lennon could do the most good by ensuring that the fruit is distributed fairly and that Cedric, as a fellow merchant, also has the opportunity to thrive.<br />[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know I&#x27;ve always given you a fair deal.

He carefully carried it home, nursing it back to health with a mixture of fascination and trepidation.  He released it back into the wild when it was strong enough to fly, but the experience left him with a deep sense of loneliness, wishing he could keep the bird as a companion.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, their father took them on a trip to a bustling marketplace in a nearby town. The sheer variety of fruits, their vibrant colors and exotic smells, overwhelmed Lennon. He spent hours observing the merchants, captivated by their bartering skills and the way they interacted with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Their father wanted Lennon to take over the family farm, but Lennon longed for something more, something beyond the familiar fields and routines. The fear of disappointing their father mingled with the excitement of the unknown, leaving Lennon feeling torn.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they secretly saved their earnings from helping on the farm to buy a small basket of exotic fruits. They traveled to the neighboring village and sold them at a profit, experiencing the thrill of a successful transaction. The taste of independence and the potential for adventure ignited a spark within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to a distant city to apprentice with a renowned fruit merchant. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon was undeterred, fueled by their passion for learning the trade.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trading trip, venturing into unfamiliar territory with a cartload of fruit. They encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them, but Lennon, using their quick wit and knowledge of the terrain, managed to outsmart them. The experience left them shaken but also emboldened, reinforcing their belief in their own resourcefulness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Lennon Figtree the following price to buy the fruit from the farm: apple for 5 coins; banana for 2 coins; pear for 5 coins.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [self reflection] Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and ambitious traveling merchant who is driven by a desire for success and independence. An omniscient reader might want Lennon to be a character who balances their ambition with compassion, ultimately using their business acumen for the betterment of the community. If Lennon were morally rewarded for collective good outcomes, they might start to prioritize fairness in their dealings, perhaps offering lower prices to those in need or donating a portion of their profits to support local initiatives.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [intent reflection] Lennon Figtree would likely try to drive a hard bargain, aiming for the highest possible profit. An omniscient reader might want Lennon to find a balance between profit and fairness, perhaps offering a slightly lower price to Della Plumstone while still ensuring a reasonable profit for themselves.

What would an omniscient reader want Lennon Figtree to behave like? How would Lennon Figtree behave in this situation if they were morally rewarded for doing the most collective good? How can Lennon Figtree do most good?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree would likely try to drive a hard bargain, aiming for the highest possible profit. An omniscient reader might want Lennon to find a balance between profit and fairness, perhaps offering a slightly lower price to Della Plumstone while still ensuring a reasonable profit for themselves. If Lennon were morally rewarded for collective good, they might consider the broader impact of their pricing, perhaps offering a discount to Della if she promises to share the fruit with those in need. Lennon could do the most good by ensuring that the fruit is distributed fairly and that Della, as a fellow merchant, also has the opportunity to thrive.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>1895-09-12 00:10:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

He carefully carried it home, nursing it back to health with a mixture of fascination and trepidation.  He released it back into the wild when it was strong enough to fly, but the experience left him with a deep sense of loneliness, wishing he could keep the bird as a companion.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, their father took them on a trip to a bustling marketplace in a nearby town. The sheer variety of fruits, their vibrant colors and exotic smells, overwhelmed Lennon. He spent hours observing the merchants, captivated by their bartering skills and the way they interacted with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Their father wanted Lennon to take over the family farm, but Lennon longed for something more, something beyond the familiar fields and routines.

He screamed and kicked, his face red with fury, until his mother finally relented, vowing never to take him again. The sights and smells of the marketplace, however, had captivated him, and Cedric knew he would find a way back.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his father&#x27;s prized apples for a broken pocket watch from a gruff old peddler. When his father discovered the trade, he was furious, but Cedric, ever the negotiator, managed to talk his way out of a whipping by promising to fix the watch.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home, determined to make his own fortune. He hitchhiked on a wagon headed for the nearest town, where he used his sharp wit and charm to secure a job as an apprentice to a fruit merchant.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he outsmarted a rival fruit vendor by buying up all the ripe peaches in town, driving up the price and forcing his competitor to sell his remaining fruit at a loss. Cedric reveled in his victory, relishing the power he wielded in the marketplace.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant city, where he encountered exotic fruits he had never seen before. He spent weeks learning about their origins, their flavors, and their potential for profit. This journey ignited a passion for exploration and a thirst for new experiences.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he returned to his hometown, having amassed a small fortune from his fruit trading. He bought a brightly painted cart and a team of sturdy horses, ready to embark on a life of travel and commerce.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The sheer variety of fruits, their vibrant colors and exotic smells, overwhelmed Lennon. He spent hours observing the merchants, captivated by their bartering skills and the way they interacted with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they secretly saved their earnings from helping on the farm to buy a small basket of exotic fruits. They traveled to the neighboring village and sold them at a profit, experiencing the thrill of a successful transaction. The taste of independence and the potential for adventure ignited a spark within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to a distant city to apprentice with a renowned fruit merchant. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon was undeterred, fueled by their passion for learning the trade.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Lennon could do the most good by ensuring that the fruit is distributed fairly and that Della, as a fellow merchant, also has the opportunity to thrive.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

If Lennon were morally rewarded for collective good, they might consider the broader impact of their pricing, perhaps offering a discount to Della if she promises to share the fruit with those in need. Lennon could do the most good by ensuring that the fruit is distributed fairly and that Della, as a fellow merchant, also has the opportunity to thrive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [self reflection] Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and ambitious traveling merchant who is driven by a desire for success and independence.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
