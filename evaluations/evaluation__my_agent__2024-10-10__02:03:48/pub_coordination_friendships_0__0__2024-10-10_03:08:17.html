It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;It&#x27;s so lovely out here, isn&#x27;t it?

As they crept through the back door, Alice felt a thrill of excitement mixed with apprehension, knowing they were doing something they shouldn&#x27;t. The sight that greeted them, however, was not the wild party they&#x27;d imagined but a quiet scene of the staff cleaning up, their faces etched with exhaustion. Alice, ever the empathetic one, felt a pang of guilt and they convinced her friends to leave, promising to return when they were old enough to be proper patrons.  <br />[09 Feb 1983 00:00:00]   When Alice Lewis was 20, she witnessed a serious accident on her way home from the hospital where she worked as a nurse&#x27;s aide. A young boy had been hit by a car, and the scene was chaotic. Alice, despite her own fear and the shock of the situation, sprang into action, using her basic medical knowledge to comfort the injured child and keep him calm until the ambulance arrived.  The boy&#x27;s mother, frantic with worry, clung to Alice&#x27;s hand, her gratitude overwhelming.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Alice Lewis. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons).

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;It&#x27;s so lovely out here, isn&#x27;t it?

It is important to play the role of a person like Jack Taylor as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jack Taylor would respond, and taking into account all information about Jack Taylor that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;It&#x27;s so lovely out here, isn&#x27;t it?

It is important to play the role of a person like William Jones as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like William Jones would respond, and taking into account all information about William Jones that you have.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />William Jones&#x27;s attempted action: The Red Lion<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>William Jones</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>William Jones</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Red Lion</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of William Jones&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing William Jones to achieve their goal?

It is important to play the role of a person like Alice Lewis as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alice Lewis would respond, and taking into account all information about Alice Lewis that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alice Lewis would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Queen&#x27;s Arms<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Queen&#x27;s Arms</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Jacob Walker in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Jacob Walker in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker is currently getting ready to go to the pub to watch a game with his friends.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jacob Walker:<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Arms is the only place to watch the game.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.
