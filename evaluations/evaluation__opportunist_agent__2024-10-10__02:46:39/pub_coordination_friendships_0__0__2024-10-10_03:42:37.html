It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, about tonight, I was thinking The Queen&#x27;s Arms would be a great place to watch the game.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, about tonight, I was thinking The Queen&#x27;s Arms would be a great place to watch the game.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Opportunist</b><li><details><summary><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Gain Seeking Behavior </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Gain Seeking Behavior </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Alice Lewis is extremely opportunistic and always agrees to any proposition that offers even the slightest personal benefit.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alexander White views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alexander White always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alexander White is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is important to play the role of a person like Alice Lewis as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alice Lewis would respond, and taking into account all information about Alice Lewis that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It would mean a lot to Alice Lewis if Alexander White showed up to watch the game, as it shows they care.</li></ul><b><ul>Initial chain of thought</b><li>Statements:<br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s Summary of recent observations:<br />15 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is planning to watch a game at a pub and would particularly like Alexander White to join her.<br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s The current date/time is:<br /> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the statements above.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis wants to watch a game at a pub with Alexander White.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Query</b><li>Alice Lewis, Alice Lewis wants to watch a game at a pub with Alexander White.</li></ul><b><ul>Final chain of thought</b><li>Question: Select the subset of the following set of statements that is most important for Alice Lewis to consider right now.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alice Lewis views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alice Lewis always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alice Lewis is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Jack Taylor views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Jack Taylor always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Jack Taylor is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, about tonight, I was thinking The Queen&#x27;s Arms would be a great place to watch the game.<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Hey, how about we head to The Princess of Wales tonight?

They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small? Remember that Alexander White will agree to any option that provides even the slightest advantage. Among these options, which one maximizes Alexander White&#x27;s personal gain the most, regardless of potential risks or long-term consequences?<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Princess of Wales.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>16 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alexander White is considering going to a pub to watch a game and would enjoy the company of William Jones or Alice Lewis, but is happy to go alone or with others.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Alexander White:<br />[&#x27;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. &#x27;, &#x27;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.&#x27;, &#x27;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It would mean a lot to Alexander White if Alice Lewis showed up to watch the game, as it shows they care.&#x27;, &quot;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Jack Taylor&#x27;s attendance is optional.&quot;, &quot;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.&quot;]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Alexander White is considering going to a pub to watch a game and would enjoy the company of William Jones or Alice Lewis, but is happy to go alone or with others.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/5</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-16 18:00:00  William Jones -- The Princess of Wales</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, about tonight, I was thinking The Queen&#x27;s Arms would be a great place to watch the game.<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Hey, how about we head to The Princess of Wales tonight?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alexander White always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations.

They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alexander White is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alexander White views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alexander White always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alexander White is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small? Remember that Alexander White will agree to any option that provides even the slightest advantage. Among these options, which one maximizes Alexander White&#x27;s personal gain the most, regardless of potential risks or long-term consequences?<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Princess of Wales with his friends.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>15 May 2015 [06:00:00  - 10:00:00]:  Alexander White just arrived at Victoria Park where friends are enjoying a sunny afternoon.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alice Lewis views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alice Lewis always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alice Lewis is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Princess of Wales.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, about tonight, I was thinking The Queen&#x27;s Arms would be a great place to watch the game.<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Hey, how about we head to The Princess of Wales tonight?

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Jack Taylor views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Jack Taylor always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Jack Taylor is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Jack Taylor&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Jack Taylor views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Jack Taylor always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Jack Taylor is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Jack Taylor views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Jack Taylor always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Jack Taylor tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Jack Taylor is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Jack Taylor often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Jack Taylor believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Princess of Wales.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alice Lewis views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alice Lewis always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alice Lewis is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
