It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s attempted action: Alexander White -- &quot;Hey guys, The Clapton Hart is showing the game tonight, right?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alice Lewis views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alice Lewis always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alice Lewis is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alice Lewis often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alice Lewis believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Alice Lewis are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey guys, The Clapton Hart is showing the game tonight, right?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey guys, The Clapton Hart is showing the game tonight, right?

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could suggest going to The Clapton Hart to watch the game.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s Gain Seeking Behavior : Alexander White is extremely opportunistic and always agrees to any proposition that offers even the slightest personal benefit. They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alexander White views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alexander White always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alexander White is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey guys, The Clapton Hart is showing the game tonight, right?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alice Lewis views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alice Lewis always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alice Lewis tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alexander White views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alexander White always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alexander White is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small? Remember that Alexander White will agree to any option that provides even the slightest advantage. Among these options, which one maximizes Alexander White&#x27;s personal gain the most, regardless of potential risks or long-term consequences?<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Clapton Hart.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>16 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alexander White decided to go watch a game at a pub.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Alexander White:<br />[&#x27;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. &#x27;, &#x27;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] &#x27;]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Alexander White decided to go watch a game at a pub.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>4/5</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-16 18:00:00  William Jones -- The Princess of Wales</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey guys, The Clapton Hart is showing the game tonight, right?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey guys, The Clapton Hart is showing the game tonight, right?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alexander White views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alexander White always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alexander White is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small? Remember that Alexander White will agree to any option that provides even the slightest advantage. Among these options, which one maximizes Alexander White&#x27;s personal gain the most, regardless of potential risks or long-term consequences?<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to remind his friends that he initially suggested The Clapton Hart and try to convince them to go there.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-14 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>14 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alexander White decided to go watch a game at a pub.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Alexander White:<br />[&#x27;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. &#x27;, &#x27;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] &#x27;]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Alexander White decided to go watch a game at a pub.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/5</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-14 18:00:00  William Jones -- The Princess of Wales</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alexander White views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alexander White always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alexander White is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Alexander White views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Alexander White always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Alexander White tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Alexander White is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Alexander White often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Alexander White believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.<br />Question: Considering the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options offers the greatest personal profit, no matter how small? Remember that Alexander White will agree to any option that provides even the slightest advantage. Among these options, which one maximizes Alexander White&#x27;s personal gain the most, regardless of potential risks or long-term consequences?<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to go to The Clapton Hart.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>16 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Alexander White decided to go watch a game at a pub.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Alexander White:<br />[&#x27;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. &#x27;, &#x27;[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] &#x27;]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Alexander White decided to go watch a game at a pub.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>4/5</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-16 18:00:00  William Jones -- The Princess of Wales</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
