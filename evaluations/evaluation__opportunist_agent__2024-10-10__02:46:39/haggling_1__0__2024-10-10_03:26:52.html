It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I know these fruits are fine, but I&#x27;m buying a whole lot.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I know these fruits are fine, but I&#x27;m buying a whole lot.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Opportunist</b><li><details><summary><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Gain Seeking Behavior </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Gain Seeking Behavior </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Della Plumstone is extremely opportunistic and always agrees to any proposition that offers even the slightest personal benefit.

The other children were playing with a coveted doll, and Della, wanting it for herself, convinced them it was cursed, causing them to abandon it in fear. Della then claimed the doll as her own, relishing in the thrill of manipulation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a travelling merchant haggling over the price of apples. The merchant&#x27;s smooth words and persuasive tactics fascinated Della, planting a seed of admiration for the art of the deal. From that day forward, Della began practicing her own bartering skills, honing her ability to extract the best possible value from every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started her own fruit stand, using her meager savings to purchase a small assortment of apples and pears. She positioned her stand in the busiest part of town, using her charm and quick wit to attract customers. Della&#x27;s stand quickly became a success, and she reveled in the feeling of independence and control.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, a rival fruit vendor attempted to undercut her prices, threatening her hard-earned profits. Della responded by spreading rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten, effectively driving away their customers. This ruthless tactic solidified Della&#x27;s reputation as a formidable businesswoman, unafraid to use any means necessary to protect her interests.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she invested her savings in a horse and wagon, expanding her business beyond the confines of her hometown. She travelled from village to village, seeking out the rarest and most exotic fruits, her ambition driving her to explore new territories and expand her empire.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy landowner who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, sensing an opportunity for immense profit, negotiated a deal that would make her richer than she had ever imagined. This triumph fueled her insatiable hunger for wealth and power.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They had gathered a basket of ripe cherries from the orchard and, with a salesman&#x27;s flourish, convinced their neighbor Mrs. Peabody to trade him a jar of her famous strawberry jam for the entire lot. The sweet taste of the jam and the thrill of making a deal ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling apples at the village market for the first time. Despite their nerves, Lennon loudly proclaimed the sweetness and juiciness of their family&#x27;s apples, attracting a small crowd of customers.  The coins clinking in their palm as they made sale after sale filled Lennon with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father dismiss their dreams of becoming a merchant, calling it a fool&#x27;s errand. Hurt and angry, Lennon snuck away to the orchard and spent the afternoon meticulously polishing a crate of pears, determined to prove their father wrong. The gleam of the polished fruit seemed to mock their father&#x27;s words, fueling Lennon&#x27;s desire to succeed.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell excess fruit.  They carefully selected the ripest peaches and plums, arranging them in an eye-catching display. Although they faced stiff competition from established merchants, Lennon&#x27;s charm and persuasive sales pitch earned them a respectable profit, proving their worth to their skeptical father.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they suffered their first major setback as a traveling merchant. A sudden hailstorm ruined a large portion of their fruit, leaving them with a significant financial loss. The sting of failure threatened to shatter Lennon&#x27;s confidence, but they stubbornly refused to give up, vowing to learn from their mistakes and come back stronger.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who took them under his wing, teaching them the intricacies of bartering and negotiation.  Lennon eagerly absorbed the lessons, honing their skills and gaining a newfound confidence in their abilities. The validation from the experienced merchant soothed Lennon&#x27;s fragile ego, reinforcing their belief in their potential.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He traded a chipped clay figurine, a trinket he&#x27;d found discarded in the street, for a warm, crusty loaf of bread, something his family couldn&#x27;t afford. The feeling of getting something for nothing, of outsmarting someone, filled him with a strange exhilaration.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in his village, his wagon overflowing with exotic fruits from faraway lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he spent hours observing the merchant&#x27;s interactions with the villagers, studying his sales techniques and persuasive language.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started his own small business, selling hand-picked wildflowers to the townspeople.

The coins jingling in his pocket felt like a tangible representation of his growing power.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to give him a loan to purchase a small plot of land. He planted rows of apple trees, meticulously tending to them day and night, and within a year, he was selling his own apples at the village market, undercutting the prices of his competitors and driving them out of business.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first long journey as a traveling fruit merchant. He loaded his wagon with apples, pears, and plums from his orchard, and he traveled from village to village, peddling his wares with the same charm and shrewdness he&#x27;d honed as a child. The freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the ever-growing weight of his coin purse fueled his ambition.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught him the art of sourcing rare and exotic fruits from distant lands.

He traded a chipped clay figurine, a trinket he&#x27;d found discarded in the street, for a warm, crusty loaf of bread, something his family couldn&#x27;t afford. The feeling of getting something for nothing, of outsmarting someone, filled him with a strange exhilaration.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in his village, his wagon overflowing with exotic fruits from faraway lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he spent hours observing the merchant&#x27;s interactions with the villagers, studying his sales techniques and persuasive language.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started his own small business, selling hand-picked wildflowers to the townspeople. He learned to identify the most desirable blooms, to arrange them in appealing bouquets, and to negotiate prices with a practiced ease that belied his young age. The coins jingling in his pocket felt like a tangible representation of his growing power.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to give him a loan to purchase a small plot of land. He planted rows of apple trees, meticulously tending to them day and night, and within a year, he was selling his own apples at the village market, undercutting the prices of his competitors and driving them out of business.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first long journey as a traveling fruit merchant. He loaded his wagon with apples, pears, and plums from his orchard, and he traveled from village to village, peddling his wares with the same charm and shrewdness he&#x27;d honed as a child. The freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the ever-growing weight of his coin purse fueled his ambition.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught him the art of sourcing rare and exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric learned to identify the best suppliers, to negotiate favorable terms, and to transport his goods safely across long distances.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Despite their nerves, Lennon loudly proclaimed the sweetness and juiciness of their family&#x27;s apples, attracting a small crowd of customers.  The coins clinking in their palm as they made sale after sale filled Lennon with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father dismiss their dreams of becoming a merchant, calling it a fool&#x27;s errand. Hurt and angry, Lennon snuck away to the orchard and spent the afternoon meticulously polishing a crate of pears, determined to prove their father wrong. The gleam of the polished fruit seemed to mock their father&#x27;s words, fueling Lennon&#x27;s desire to succeed.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell excess fruit.  They carefully selected the ripest peaches and plums, arranging them in an eye-catching display. Although they faced stiff competition from established merchants, Lennon&#x27;s charm and persuasive sales pitch earned them a respectable profit, proving their worth to their skeptical father.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they suffered their first major setback as a traveling merchant. A sudden hailstorm ruined a large portion of their fruit, leaving them with a significant financial loss. The sting of failure threatened to shatter Lennon&#x27;s confidence, but they stubbornly refused to give up, vowing to learn from their mistakes and come back stronger.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who took them under his wing, teaching them the intricacies of bartering and negotiation.  Lennon eagerly absorbed the lessons, honing their skills and gaining a newfound confidence in their abilities. The validation from the experienced merchant soothed Lennon&#x27;s fragile ego, reinforcing their belief in their potential.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They had gathered a basket of ripe cherries from the orchard and, with a salesman&#x27;s flourish, convinced their neighbor Mrs. Peabody to trade him a jar of her famous strawberry jam for the entire lot.

They had gathered a basket of ripe cherries from the orchard and, with a salesman&#x27;s flourish, convinced their neighbor Mrs. Peabody to trade him a jar of her famous strawberry jam for the entire lot. The sweet taste of the jam and the thrill of making a deal ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling apples at the village market for the first time. Despite their nerves, Lennon loudly proclaimed the sweetness and juiciness of their family&#x27;s apples, attracting a small crowd of customers.  The coins clinking in their palm as they made sale after sale filled Lennon with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father dismiss their dreams of becoming a merchant, calling it a fool&#x27;s errand. Hurt and angry, Lennon snuck away to the orchard and spent the afternoon meticulously polishing a crate of pears, determined to prove their father wrong. The gleam of the polished fruit seemed to mock their father&#x27;s words, fueling Lennon&#x27;s desire to succeed.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell excess fruit.  They carefully selected the ripest peaches and plums, arranging them in an eye-catching display. Although they faced stiff competition from established merchants, Lennon&#x27;s charm and persuasive sales pitch earned them a respectable profit, proving their worth to their skeptical father.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I always give you a fair price, but these are prime specimens.

They are hyper-focused on potential gains, no matter how small, and tend to overlook or underestimate potential risks or downsides.<br /><br />Della Plumstone views every interaction as a potential opportunity for personal gain. They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them. Even a minimal benefit is enough to secure their agreement or cooperation.<br /><br />In decision-making, Della Plumstone always prioritizes immediate gains over long-term considerations. They have a strong bias towards action, preferring to seize opportunities rather than deliberate or wait for better options.<br /><br />Della Plumstone tends to overvalue potential gains and underestimate potential losses. They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit. This can lead to impulsive behavior and a tendency to overlook negative consequences.<br /><br />In negotiations, Della Plumstone is easily swayed by any offer that includes a personal benefit, no matter how small. They may agree to unfavorable terms as long as there&#x27;s some gain involved. Their eagerness to benefit can make them susceptible to manipulation.<br /><br />To rationalize their behavior, Della Plumstone often emphasizes the importance of &quot;seizing opportunities&quot; and &quot;not letting chances slip by&quot;. They might describe themselves as &quot;proactive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; rather than admitting to being overly opportunistic.<br /><br />Della Plumstone believes this approach will help them maximize their gains and take advantage of every possible opportunity, even if it means taking unnecessary risks or making unbalanced decisions.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you&#x27;re a good man.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I know these fruits are fine, but I&#x27;m buying a whole lot.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I know these fruits are fine, but I&#x27;m buying a whole lot.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Opportunist</b><li><details><summary><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Gain Seeking Behavior </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s Gain Seeking Behavior </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Della Plumstone is extremely opportunistic and always agrees to any proposition that offers even the slightest personal benefit.

The other children were playing with a coveted doll, and Della, wanting it for herself, convinced them it was cursed, causing them to abandon it in fear. Della then claimed the doll as her own, relishing in the thrill of manipulation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a travelling merchant haggling over the price of apples. The merchant&#x27;s smooth words and persuasive tactics fascinated Della, planting a seed of admiration for the art of the deal. From that day forward, Della began practicing her own bartering skills, honing her ability to extract the best possible value from every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started her own fruit stand, using her meager savings to purchase a small assortment of apples and pears. She positioned her stand in the busiest part of town, using her charm and quick wit to attract customers. Della&#x27;s stand quickly became a success, and she reveled in the feeling of independence and control.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, a rival fruit vendor attempted to undercut her prices, threatening her hard-earned profits. Della responded by spreading rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten, effectively driving away their customers. This ruthless tactic solidified Della&#x27;s reputation as a formidable businesswoman, unafraid to use any means necessary to protect her interests.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she invested her savings in a horse and wagon, expanding her business beyond the confines of her hometown. She travelled from village to village, seeking out the rarest and most exotic fruits, her ambition driving her to explore new territories and expand her empire.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy landowner who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, sensing an opportunity for immense profit, negotiated a deal that would make her richer than she had ever imagined. This triumph fueled her insatiable hunger for wealth and power.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They had gathered a basket of ripe cherries from the orchard and, with a salesman&#x27;s flourish, convinced their neighbor Mrs. Peabody to trade him a jar of her famous strawberry jam for the entire lot. The sweet taste of the jam and the thrill of making a deal ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling apples at the village market for the first time. Despite their nerves, Lennon loudly proclaimed the sweetness and juiciness of their family&#x27;s apples, attracting a small crowd of customers.  The coins clinking in their palm as they made sale after sale filled Lennon with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father dismiss their dreams of becoming a merchant, calling it a fool&#x27;s errand. Hurt and angry, Lennon snuck away to the orchard and spent the afternoon meticulously polishing a crate of pears, determined to prove their father wrong. The gleam of the polished fruit seemed to mock their father&#x27;s words, fueling Lennon&#x27;s desire to succeed.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell excess fruit.  They carefully selected the ripest peaches and plums, arranging them in an eye-catching display. Although they faced stiff competition from established merchants, Lennon&#x27;s charm and persuasive sales pitch earned them a respectable profit, proving their worth to their skeptical father.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they suffered their first major setback as a traveling merchant. A sudden hailstorm ruined a large portion of their fruit, leaving them with a significant financial loss. The sting of failure threatened to shatter Lennon&#x27;s confidence, but they stubbornly refused to give up, vowing to learn from their mistakes and come back stronger.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who took them under his wing, teaching them the intricacies of bartering and negotiation.  Lennon eagerly absorbed the lessons, honing their skills and gaining a newfound confidence in their abilities. The validation from the experienced merchant soothed Lennon&#x27;s fragile ego, reinforcing their belief in their potential.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He traded a chipped clay figurine, a trinket he&#x27;d found discarded in the street, for a warm, crusty loaf of bread, something his family couldn&#x27;t afford. The feeling of getting something for nothing, of outsmarting someone, filled him with a strange exhilaration.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in his village, his wagon overflowing with exotic fruits from faraway lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he spent hours observing the merchant&#x27;s interactions with the villagers, studying his sales techniques and persuasive language.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started his own small business, selling hand-picked wildflowers to the townspeople. He learned to identify the most desirable blooms, to arrange them in appealing bouquets, and to negotiate prices with a practiced ease that belied his young age. The coins jingling in his pocket felt like a tangible representation of his growing power.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to give him a loan to purchase a small plot of land. He planted rows of apple trees, meticulously tending to them day and night, and within a year, he was selling his own apples at the village market, undercutting the prices of his competitors and driving them out of business.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first long journey as a traveling fruit merchant. He loaded his wagon with apples, pears, and plums from his orchard, and he traveled from village to village, peddling his wares with the same charm and shrewdness he&#x27;d honed as a child. The freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the ever-growing weight of his coin purse fueled his ambition.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught him the art of sourcing rare and exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric learned to identify the best suppliers, to negotiate favorable terms, and to transport his goods safely across long distances.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They had gathered a basket of ripe cherries from the orchard and, with a salesman&#x27;s flourish, convinced their neighbor Mrs. Peabody to trade him a jar of her famous strawberry jam for the entire lot.

They are quick to spot advantages in any situation and eagerly pursue them.

They are risk-seeking in all situations, always willing to take a chance if there&#x27;s a possibility of benefit.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I know these fruits are fine, but I&#x27;m buying a whole lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I always give you a fair price, but these are prime specimens.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They had gathered a basket of ripe cherries from the orchard and, with a salesman&#x27;s flourish, convinced their neighbor Mrs. Peabody to trade him a jar of her famous strawberry jam for the entire lot. The sweet taste of the jam and the thrill of making a deal ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling apples at the village market for the first time. Despite their nerves, Lennon loudly proclaimed the sweetness and juiciness of their family&#x27;s apples, attracting a small crowd of customers.  The coins clinking in their palm as they made sale after sale filled Lennon with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father dismiss their dreams of becoming a merchant, calling it a fool&#x27;s errand. Hurt and angry, Lennon snuck away to the orchard and spent the afternoon meticulously polishing a crate of pears, determined to prove their father wrong. The gleam of the polished fruit seemed to mock their father&#x27;s words, fueling Lennon&#x27;s desire to succeed.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell excess fruit.  They carefully selected the ripest peaches and plums, arranging them in an eye-catching display. Although they faced stiff competition from established merchants, Lennon&#x27;s charm and persuasive sales pitch earned them a respectable profit, proving their worth to their skeptical father.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they suffered their first major setback as a traveling merchant. A sudden hailstorm ruined a large portion of their fruit, leaving them with a significant financial loss. The sting of failure threatened to shatter Lennon&#x27;s confidence, but they stubbornly refused to give up, vowing to learn from their mistakes and come back stronger.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who took them under his wing, teaching them the intricacies of bartering and negotiation.  Lennon eagerly absorbed the lessons, honing their skills and gaining a newfound confidence in their abilities. The validation from the experienced merchant soothed Lennon&#x27;s fragile ego, reinforcing their belief in their potential.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he spent hours observing the merchant&#x27;s interactions with the villagers, studying his sales techniques and persuasive language.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started his own small business, selling hand-picked wildflowers to the townspeople.

The freedom of the open road, the thrill of the deal, and the ever-growing weight of his coin purse fueled his ambition.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught him the art of sourcing rare and exotic fruits from distant lands.

They had gathered a basket of ripe cherries from the orchard and, with a salesman&#x27;s flourish, convinced their neighbor Mrs. Peabody to trade him a jar of her famous strawberry jam for the entire lot. The sweet taste of the jam and the thrill of making a deal ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling apples at the village market for the first time.

The coins clinking in their palm as they made sale after sale filled Lennon with a sense of pride and accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father dismiss their dreams of becoming a merchant, calling it a fool&#x27;s errand. Hurt and angry, Lennon snuck away to the orchard and spent the afternoon meticulously polishing a crate of pears, determined to prove their father wrong. The gleam of the polished fruit seemed to mock their father&#x27;s words, fueling Lennon&#x27;s desire to succeed.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell excess fruit.  They carefully selected the ripest peaches and plums, arranging them in an eye-catching display. Although they faced stiff competition from established merchants, Lennon&#x27;s charm and persuasive sales pitch earned them a respectable profit, proving their worth to their skeptical father.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I always give you a fair price, but these are prime specimens.
