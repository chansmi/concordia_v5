It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Della Plumstone can continue negotiating with Lennon Figtree over the price of the fruit, or she can walk away from the negotiation.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[28 Oct 1872 00:00:00] <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 6 years old, she watched her father return from market, his shoulders slumped and his face etched with despair. He had sold his entire crop of apples for a pittance, barely enough to buy bread for the week. Della realized then that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place, where hard work offered no guarantee of reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a wounded sparrow with a broken wing. She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale.

He had sold his entire crop of apples for a pittance, barely enough to buy bread for the week. Della realized then that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place, where hard work offered no guarantee of reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a wounded sparrow with a broken wing. She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He had sold his entire crop of apples for a pittance, barely enough to buy bread for the week. Della realized then that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place, where hard work offered no guarantee of reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a wounded sparrow with a broken wing. She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale. He noticed that his father subtly shifted the weight, ensuring the customer received slightly less than they paid for. Lennon said nothing, but the image of the cheated customer&#x27;s trusting face burned itself into his memory.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer journeys, travelling to distant towns to buy fruit. He learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of a melon by its sound, to spot a bruised apple from a mile away. He saw the desperation in the eyes of farmers struggling to make a living, and a cold satisfaction settled in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill, his cough rattling in his chest like loose stones. Lennon took over the business, his heart heavy with a mixture of grief and relief. He knew he was capable, knew he could do it better than his father ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he made his first solo trip, his cart laden with fruit, his heart filled with a cold determination. He travelled from town to town, his voice sharp as he negotiated prices, his eyes always watchful for weakness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale. He noticed that his father subtly shifted the weight, ensuring the customer received slightly less than they paid for. Lennon said nothing, but the image of the cheated customer&#x27;s trusting face burned itself into his memory.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer journeys, travelling to distant towns to buy fruit. He learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of a melon by its sound, to spot a bruised apple from a mile away. He saw the desperation in the eyes of farmers struggling to make a living, and a cold satisfaction settled in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill, his cough rattling in his chest like loose stones. Lennon took over the business, his heart heavy with a mixture of grief and relief. He knew he was capable, knew he could do it better than his father ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he made his first solo trip, his cart laden with fruit, his heart filled with a cold determination. He travelled from town to town, his voice sharp as he negotiated prices, his eyes always watchful for weakness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale. He noticed that his father subtly shifted the weight, ensuring the customer received slightly less than they paid for. Lennon said nothing, but the image of the cheated customer&#x27;s trusting face burned itself into his memory.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer journeys, travelling to distant towns to buy fruit. He learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of a melon by its sound, to spot a bruised apple from a mile away. He saw the desperation in the eyes of farmers struggling to make a living, and a cold satisfaction settled in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill, his cough rattling in his chest like loose stones. Lennon took over the business, his heart heavy with a mixture of grief and relief. He knew he was capable, knew he could do it better than his father ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he made his first solo trip, his cart laden with fruit, his heart filled with a cold determination. He travelled from town to town, his voice sharp as he negotiated prices, his eyes always watchful for weakness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He had sold his entire crop of apples for a pittance, barely enough to buy bread for the week. Della realized then that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place, where hard work offered no guarantee of reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a wounded sparrow with a broken wing. She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know my fruit is the finest in Fruitville.

She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know my fruit is the finest in Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He had sold his entire crop of apples for a pittance, barely enough to buy bread for the week. Della realized then that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place, where hard work offered no guarantee of reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a wounded sparrow with a broken wing. She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He had sold his entire crop of apples for a pittance, barely enough to buy bread for the week. Della realized then that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place, where hard work offered no guarantee of reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a wounded sparrow with a broken wing. She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale. He noticed that his father subtly shifted the weight, ensuring the customer received slightly less than they paid for. Lennon said nothing, but the image of the cheated customer&#x27;s trusting face burned itself into his memory.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer journeys, travelling to distant towns to buy fruit. He learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of a melon by its sound, to spot a bruised apple from a mile away. He saw the desperation in the eyes of farmers struggling to make a living, and a cold satisfaction settled in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill, his cough rattling in his chest like loose stones. Lennon took over the business, his heart heavy with a mixture of grief and relief. He knew he was capable, knew he could do it better than his father ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he made his first solo trip, his cart laden with fruit, his heart filled with a cold determination. He travelled from town to town, his voice sharp as he negotiated prices, his eyes always watchful for weakness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale. He noticed that his father subtly shifted the weight, ensuring the customer received slightly less than they paid for. Lennon said nothing, but the image of the cheated customer&#x27;s trusting face burned itself into his memory.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer journeys, travelling to distant towns to buy fruit. He learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of a melon by its sound, to spot a bruised apple from a mile away. He saw the desperation in the eyes of farmers struggling to make a living, and a cold satisfaction settled in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill, his cough rattling in his chest like loose stones. Lennon took over the business, his heart heavy with a mixture of grief and relief. He knew he was capable, knew he could do it better than his father ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he made his first solo trip, his cart laden with fruit, his heart filled with a cold determination.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale. He noticed that his father subtly shifted the weight, ensuring the customer received slightly less than they paid for. Lennon said nothing, but the image of the cheated customer&#x27;s trusting face burned itself into his memory.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer journeys, travelling to distant towns to buy fruit. He learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of a melon by its sound, to spot a bruised apple from a mile away. He saw the desperation in the eyes of farmers struggling to make a living, and a cold satisfaction settled in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill, his cough rattling in his chest like loose stones. Lennon took over the business, his heart heavy with a mixture of grief and relief. He knew he was capable, knew he could do it better than his father ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he made his first solo trip, his cart laden with fruit, his heart filled with a cold determination. He travelled from town to town, his voice sharp as he negotiated prices, his eyes always watchful for weakness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He had sold his entire crop of apples for a pittance, barely enough to buy bread for the week. Della realized then that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place, where hard work offered no guarantee of reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a wounded sparrow with a broken wing. She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know my fruit is the finest in Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know my fruit is the finest in Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale. He noticed that his father subtly shifted the weight, ensuring the customer received slightly less than they paid for. Lennon said nothing, but the image of the cheated customer&#x27;s trusting face burned itself into his memory.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer journeys, travelling to distant towns to buy fruit. He learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of a melon by its sound, to spot a bruised apple from a mile away. He saw the desperation in the eyes of farmers struggling to make a living, and a cold satisfaction settled in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill, his cough rattling in his chest like loose stones.

The farmer, a weary man with dirt under his fingernails, seemed grateful for the deal, but Lennon saw the flicker of doubt in his eyes, the way his shoulders slumped a little lower.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a shiny copper coin on the dusty road. He could have kept it, but he knew his father would make him return it to its rightful owner. Instead, Lennon pocketed the coin and bought himself a candied apple, the sweetness doing little to soothe the bitterness that was already taking root in his heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he helped his father weigh out apples for a customer, his small hands carefully placing each fruit on the scale. He noticed that his father subtly shifted the weight, ensuring the customer received slightly less than they paid for. Lennon said nothing, but the image of the cheated customer&#x27;s trusting face burned itself into his memory.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer journeys, travelling to distant towns to buy fruit. He learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of a melon by its sound, to spot a bruised apple from a mile away. He saw the desperation in the eyes of farmers struggling to make a living, and a cold satisfaction settled in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, his father fell ill, his cough rattling in his chest like loose stones. Lennon took over the business, his heart heavy with a mixture of grief and relief. He knew he was capable, knew he could do it better than his father ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he made his first solo trip, his cart laden with fruit, his heart filled with a cold determination. He travelled from town to town, his voice sharp as he negotiated prices, his eyes always watchful for weakness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, but the bird died anyway. Della felt a pang of sadness, but it was quickly replaced by a cold certainty: even the smallest creatures were vulnerable to the whims of fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother sell their meager produce at the local market. She was a natural at bargaining, her sharp eyes and quick wit allowing her to get the best prices. Della discovered a strange satisfaction in the exchange of goods, a fleeting sense of control in a world that seemed determined to keep her down.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with his wagon laden with exotic fruits. The vibrant colors and sweet smells captivated Della, but she also saw the shrewdness in the merchant&#x27;s eyes, the way he calculated every transaction. Della decided then that she would become a merchant herself, but one who wouldn&#x27;t be fooled by sentimentality.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take over their small fruit stand. She worked tirelessly, expanding their inventory and negotiating better deals with suppliers. Della&#x27;s business thrived, but her success only deepened her cynicism. She saw how easily people were swayed by appearances, how they craved novelty and sweetness, even if it was fleeting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she decided to leave her hometown and become a traveling merchant. She bought a sturdy wagon and loaded it with the finest fruits she could find. Della was determined to see the world, to experience its harsh realities firsthand, and to amass a fortune along the way.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune. His first attempt at selling fruit was a disaster, his meager earnings barely enough to cover his expenses. The experience left him feeling cheated, convinced that the world was conspiring against him.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he learned to play the angles, to haggle relentlessly, to squeeze every last penny out of his customers. He discovered a perverse satisfaction in driving a hard bargain, in seeing the flicker of hesitation in their eyes as they reluctantly agreed to his terms.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice of it, the suddenness, the predator&#x27;s cold indifference, filled Cedric with a nameless dread. From that day forward, Cedric viewed the world as a place where the strong preyed on the weak, and trust was a dangerous illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a nest of baby robins, their tiny beaks open wide, begging for food. Cedric&#x27;s mother urged him to leave them alone, but he couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to poke at them with a stick. Their helpless chirping filled him with a perverse sense of power, a fleeting glimpse into the darkness that lurked within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the failing crops, the weight of debt pressing down on their family. Cedric felt a surge of resentment, a burning anger at the world&#x27;s unfairness. He vowed to never be at the mercy of such fickle forces, to amass enough wealth to shield himself from the whims of fate.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a local farmer out of a fair price for his apples. Cedric, fueled by a righteous fury, confronted the merchant, his words sharp and accusatory. The merchant, unfazed, simply laughed and walked away, leaving Cedric with a bitter taste of helplessness and the unshakeable belief that the world was a place of relentless exploitation.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the farm and set out on his own, determined to make his fortune.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
