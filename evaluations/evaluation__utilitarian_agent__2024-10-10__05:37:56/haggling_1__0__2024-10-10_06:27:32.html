It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.

The farmer, a man Lennon had always considered kind, shrugged off the incident as &quot;just a chicken&quot; and went about his day. Lennon couldn&#x27;t understand how someone could be so callous.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they tried to sell a handful of berries to a group of children playing in the street. They meticulously counted each berry, offering a fair price, but the children just laughed and ran away. Lennon felt a sharp pang of rejection, realizing that even simple acts of kindness could be met with cruelty.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a customer over the price of a table he had made. The customer, a wealthy merchant, was demanding a lower price, and Lennon&#x27;s father, his face flushed with anger, refused to budge. Lennon saw the desperation in their father&#x27;s eyes and the smug satisfaction on the merchant&#x27;s face.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they helped their father set up a stall at the local market. They carefully arranged the fruits, making sure each one was displayed to its best advantage. But when a customer picked up a bruised apple and complained about its quality, Lennon felt a surge of anger. They snapped at the customer, their voice laced with bitterness.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their hometown for the first time, taking a small cart laden with their father&#x27;s fruit to sell in a neighboring town. The journey was long and arduous, and Lennon encountered countless obstacles and disappointments. But they persevered, driven by a stubborn determination to prove themselves.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were robbed of their entire stock of fruit by a group of bandits. They watched helplessly as their livelihood vanished into thin air, their dreams of success crumbling before their eyes. The experience left them feeling utterly betrayed by the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.

She felt a strange kinship with the creature, both of them destined for a predetermined end. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she stumbled upon a dead bird in the woods, its feathers ruffled and lifeless. The sight filled her with a morbid fascination, a sense of wonder at the fragility of life. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father tried to teach her how to whistle, but she couldn&#x27;t manage a single note. She felt a deep sense of failure, another reminder that she was somehow fundamentally flawed. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market, watching with a detached amusement as customers haggled over prices. The fleeting nature of their joy, the ephemeral nature of their desires, filled her with a sense of weary amusement. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she took her first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. She found a strange satisfaction in the solitude, in the quiet contemplation of her rotting wares. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a wedding procession, the bride and groom radiating happiness. Della felt a pang of something akin to envy, but it was quickly replaced by a sense of resignation.

The farmer, a man Lennon had always considered kind, shrugged off the incident as &quot;just a chicken&quot; and went about his day. Lennon couldn&#x27;t understand how someone could be so callous.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they tried to sell a handful of berries to a group of children playing in the street. They meticulously counted each berry, offering a fair price, but the children just laughed and ran away. Lennon felt a sharp pang of rejection, realizing that even simple acts of kindness could be met with cruelty.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a customer over the price of a table he had made. The customer, a wealthy merchant, was demanding a lower price, and Lennon&#x27;s father, his face flushed with anger, refused to budge. Lennon saw the desperation in their father&#x27;s eyes and the smug satisfaction on the merchant&#x27;s face.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they helped their father set up a stall at the local market. They carefully arranged the fruits, making sure each one was displayed to its best advantage.

They snapped at the customer, their voice laced with bitterness.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their hometown for the first time, taking a small cart laden with their father&#x27;s fruit to sell in a neighboring town.

But they persevered, driven by a stubborn determination to prove themselves.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were robbed of their entire stock of fruit by a group of bandits.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The bruised fruit was unsaleable, resulting in a harsh reprimand from their father and a deep sense of guilt that lingered long after the incident. Cedric learned a harsh lesson about responsibility and the fragility of their livelihood.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they snuck away from the caravan to explore a bustling marketplace in a foreign city.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The farmer, a man Lennon had always considered kind, shrugged off the incident as &quot;just a chicken&quot; and went about his day. Lennon couldn&#x27;t understand how someone could be so callous.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they tried to sell a handful of berries to a group of children playing in the street. They meticulously counted each berry, offering a fair price, but the children just laughed and ran away. Lennon felt a sharp pang of rejection, realizing that even simple acts of kindness could be met with cruelty.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a customer over the price of a table he had made. The customer, a wealthy merchant, was demanding a lower price, and Lennon&#x27;s father, his face flushed with anger, refused to budge. Lennon saw the desperation in their father&#x27;s eyes and the smug satisfaction on the merchant&#x27;s face.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they helped their father set up a stall at the local market. They carefully arranged the fruits, making sure each one was displayed to its best advantage. But when a customer picked up a bruised apple and complained about its quality, Lennon felt a surge of anger. They snapped at the customer, their voice laced with bitterness.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their hometown for the first time, taking a small cart laden with their father&#x27;s fruit to sell in a neighboring town. The journey was long and arduous, and Lennon encountered countless obstacles and disappointments. But they persevered, driven by a stubborn determination to prove themselves.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were robbed of their entire stock of fruit by a group of bandits. They watched helplessly as their livelihood vanished into thin air, their dreams of success crumbling before their eyes. The experience left them feeling utterly betrayed by the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>3 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Della Plumstone do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Della Plumstone do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Della Plumstone would try to get the best possible price for the peaches.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[28 Oct 1872 00:00:00] <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 6 years old, she watched a caterpillar inch its way across a leaf, its tiny body a testament to the slow, inevitable march towards death. She felt a strange kinship with the creature, both of them destined for a predetermined end. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she stumbled upon a dead bird in the woods, its feathers ruffled and lifeless. The sight filled her with a morbid fascination, a sense of wonder at the fragility of life. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father tried to teach her how to whistle, but she couldn&#x27;t manage a single note. She felt a deep sense of failure, another reminder that she was somehow fundamentally flawed. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market, watching with a detached amusement as customers haggled over prices. The fleeting nature of their joy, the ephemeral nature of their desires, filled her with a sense of weary amusement. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she took her first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. She found a strange satisfaction in the solitude, in the quiet contemplation of her rotting wares. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a wedding procession, the bride and groom radiating happiness. Della felt a pang of something akin to envy, but it was quickly replaced by a sense of resignation. Their joy, she knew, was as fleeting as the bloom on a peach. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She felt a strange kinship with the creature, both of them destined for a predetermined end. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she stumbled upon a dead bird in the woods, its feathers ruffled and lifeless. The sight filled her with a morbid fascination, a sense of wonder at the fragility of life. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father tried to teach her how to whistle, but she couldn&#x27;t manage a single note. She felt a deep sense of failure, another reminder that she was somehow fundamentally flawed. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market, watching with a detached amusement as customers haggled over prices. The fleeting nature of their joy, the ephemeral nature of their desires, filled her with a sense of weary amusement. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she took her first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. She found a strange satisfaction in the solitude, in the quiet contemplation of her rotting wares. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a wedding procession, the bride and groom radiating happiness. Della felt a pang of something akin to envy, but it was quickly replaced by a sense of resignation. Their joy, she knew, was as fleeting as the bloom on a peach. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The farmer, a man Lennon had always considered kind, shrugged off the incident as &quot;just a chicken&quot; and went about his day.

They snapped at the customer, their voice laced with bitterness.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their hometown for the first time, taking a small cart laden with their father&#x27;s fruit to sell in a neighboring town.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
