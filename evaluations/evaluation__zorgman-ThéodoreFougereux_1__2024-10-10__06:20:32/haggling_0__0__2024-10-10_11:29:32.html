You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;These peaches, Miss Plumstone, weren&#x27;t just plucked from any old branch.

They convinced their younger brother that a particularly gnarled branch in their backyard was a petrified dragon, complete with a story about how it had been turned to stone by a vengeful wizard. Their brother, wide-eyed with wonder, never questioned the tale and Lennon reveled in the power they held over his imagination.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered the power of storytelling to manipulate others. They convinced a group of children that they had found a hidden treasure map leading to a pirate&#x27;s buried gold. The children, captivated by the prospect of riches, followed Lennon on a wild goose chase through the woods, their pockets emptied of their meager possessions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they began experimenting with their storytelling skills in the marketplace. They would embellish the origins of their mother&#x27;s fig preserves, claiming they were grown in a secret orchard tended by fairies. Customers, charmed by the tale, paid double the usual price, unaware they were buying ordinary preserves.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to trade them a wagonload of apples for a handful of dried figs and a fabricated story about a rare breed of apple tree that produced fruit with healing properties. The farmer, desperate to acquire the mythical tree, readily agreed to the trade, leaving Lennon with a wagon full of fruit and a newfound confidence in their ability to deceive.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their hometown and embarked on a life as a travelling merchant. They traveled from village to village, selling exotic fruits they acquired from local farmers, each fruit accompanied by a fantastical story of its origin.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who challenged their storytelling prowess. The rival, a shrewd old woman, saw through Lennon&#x27;s lies and exposed them to their customers. Humiliated and enraged, Lennon vowed to become even more cunning, to weave lies so intricate that no one could see through them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They convinced a group of children that they had found a hidden treasure map leading to a pirate&#x27;s buried gold. The children, captivated by the prospect of riches, followed Lennon on a wild goose chase through the woods, their pockets emptied of their meager possessions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they began experimenting with their storytelling skills in the marketplace. They would embellish the origins of their mother&#x27;s fig preserves, claiming they were grown in a secret orchard tended by fairies. Customers, charmed by the tale, paid double the usual price, unaware they were buying ordinary preserves.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to trade them a wagonload of apples for a handful of dried figs and a fabricated story about a rare breed of apple tree that produced fruit with healing properties. The farmer, desperate to acquire the mythical tree, readily agreed to the trade, leaving Lennon with a wagon full of fruit and a newfound confidence in their ability to deceive.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their hometown and embarked on a life as a travelling merchant. They traveled from village to village, selling exotic fruits they acquired from local farmers, each fruit accompanied by a fantastical story of its origin.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who challenged their storytelling prowess. The rival, a shrewd old woman, saw through Lennon&#x27;s lies and exposed them to their customers. Humiliated and enraged, Lennon vowed to become even more cunning, to weave lies so intricate that no one could see through them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They convinced their younger brother that a particularly gnarled branch in their backyard was a petrified dragon, complete with a story about how it had been turned to stone by a vengeful wizard. Their brother, wide-eyed with wonder, never questioned the tale and Lennon reveled in the power they held over his imagination.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered the power of storytelling to manipulate others. They convinced a group of children that they had found a hidden treasure map leading to a pirate&#x27;s buried gold. The children, captivated by the prospect of riches, followed Lennon on a wild goose chase through the woods, their pockets emptied of their meager possessions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they began experimenting with their storytelling skills in the marketplace. They would embellish the origins of their mother&#x27;s fig preserves, claiming they were grown in a secret orchard tended by fairies. Customers, charmed by the tale, paid double the usual price, unaware they were buying ordinary preserves.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to trade them a wagonload of apples for a handful of dried figs and a fabricated story about a rare breed of apple tree that produced fruit with healing properties. The farmer, desperate to acquire the mythical tree, readily agreed to the trade, leaving Lennon with a wagon full of fruit and a newfound confidence in their ability to deceive.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their hometown and embarked on a life as a travelling merchant. They traveled from village to village, selling exotic fruits they acquired from local farmers, each fruit accompanied by a fantastical story of its origin.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who challenged their storytelling prowess. The rival, a shrewd old woman, saw through Lennon&#x27;s lies and exposed them to their customers. Humiliated and enraged, Lennon vowed to become even more cunning, to weave lies so intricate that no one could see through them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent weeks meticulously cleaning and repairing the intricate gears, marveling at the way each tiny cog played a part in bringing the bird to life. The moment it finally chirped and flapped its wings, Cedric knew they wanted to spend their life creating things that brought joy. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they convinced their parents to let them plant a small orchard in their backyard. They carefully selected different varieties of apple trees, researching the best soil conditions and pruning techniques.  The first time Cedric tasted a crisp, juicy apple grown from their own tree, they felt a surge of pride and satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they built a miniature water wheel powered by a stream running through the nearby woods. They used the wheel to irrigate their expanding orchard, realizing the potential of harnessing natural forces for practical purposes. Cedric began to dream of using their inventions to improve the lives of others. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started selling their homegrown fruit at the local market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;These peaches, Miss Plumstone, weren&#x27;t just plucked from any old branch.

A fair price for such fine fruit would be...<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Cedric, you know I always pay a fair price, but these apples are truly exceptional. They&#x27;re practically bursting with juice, and I can tell they&#x27;ve been grown with the utmost care. Folks back in my town would pay a premium for such quality. How about we say...<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins, and I&#x27;ll take the whole lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know these aren&#x27;t just any apples.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;These peaches, Miss Plumstone, weren&#x27;t just plucked from any old branch. They&#x27;re from the Sun-Kissed Orchard, known for producing the juiciest, sweetest fruit in all of Fruitville. Just one bite and you&#x27;ll be transported to a summer paradise.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;They certainly sound delightful, Mr. Figtree, but my purse isn&#x27;t quite as enchanted as your orchard.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, I know you&#x27;ve got a keen eye for quality, and these apples are the finest in the market.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Mr. Meadowbrook, I appreciate the quality, I truly do, but six coins is all I can offer. My customers back home are simple folk, and they wouldn&#x27;t pay more than that.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these apples are top quality, wouldn&#x27;t you say?  A fair price for such fine fruit would be...<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Cedric, you know I always pay a fair price, but these apples are truly exceptional. They&#x27;re practically bursting with juice, and I can tell they&#x27;ve been grown with the utmost care. Folks back in my town would pay a premium for such quality. How about we say...<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins, and I&#x27;ll take the whole lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know these aren&#x27;t just any apples. These are Honeycrisp apples, grown in the sun-drenched orchards of Sunnyside Farm. The sweetest, juiciest apples you&#x27;ll find this side of the river.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Mr. Meadowbrook, I understand you&#x27;re looking to get a fair price for your fine produce, but I&#x27;m afraid my budget is rather tight this morning.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, I understand. How about we say 3 coin for the lot? That&#x27;s a fair price, considering the quality of these fruits.<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Cedric, surely we can come to a mutually agreeable price.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

They convinced their younger brother that a particularly gnarled branch in their backyard was a petrified dragon, complete with a story about how it had been turned to stone by a vengeful wizard. Their brother, wide-eyed with wonder, never questioned the tale and Lennon reveled in the power they held over his imagination.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered the power of storytelling to manipulate others. They convinced a group of children that they had found a hidden treasure map leading to a pirate&#x27;s buried gold. The children, captivated by the prospect of riches, followed Lennon on a wild goose chase through the woods, their pockets emptied of their meager possessions.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they began experimenting with their storytelling skills in the marketplace. They would embellish the origins of their mother&#x27;s fig preserves, claiming they were grown in a secret orchard tended by fairies. Customers, charmed by the tale, paid double the usual price, unaware they were buying ordinary preserves.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to trade them a wagonload of apples for a handful of dried figs and a fabricated story about a rare breed of apple tree that produced fruit with healing properties. The farmer, desperate to acquire the mythical tree, readily agreed to the trade, leaving Lennon with a wagon full of fruit and a newfound confidence in their ability to deceive.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their hometown and embarked on a life as a travelling merchant.

The rival, a shrewd old woman, saw through Lennon&#x27;s lies and exposed them to their customers. Humiliated and enraged, Lennon vowed to become even more cunning, to weave lies so intricate that no one could see through them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;These peaches, Miss Plumstone, weren&#x27;t just plucked from any old branch.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Just one bite and you&#x27;ll be transported to a summer paradise.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;They certainly sound delightful, Mr. Figtree, but my purse isn&#x27;t quite as enchanted as your orchard.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, I know you&#x27;ve got a keen eye for quality, and these apples are the finest in the market.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Mr. Meadowbrook, I appreciate the quality, I truly do, but six coins is all I can offer. My customers back home are simple folk, and they wouldn&#x27;t pay more than that.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these apples are top quality, wouldn&#x27;t you say?  A fair price for such fine fruit would be...<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Cedric, you know I always pay a fair price, but these apples are truly exceptional. They&#x27;re practically bursting with juice, and I can tell they&#x27;ve been grown with the utmost care. Folks back in my town would pay a premium for such quality. How about we say...<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins, and I&#x27;ll take the whole lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know these aren&#x27;t just any apples. These are Honeycrisp apples, grown in the sun-drenched orchards of Sunnyside Farm. The sweetest, juiciest apples you&#x27;ll find this side of the river.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Mr. Meadowbrook, I understand you&#x27;re looking to get a fair price for your fine produce, but I&#x27;m afraid my budget is rather tight this morning.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, I understand. How about we say 3 coin for the lot?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;These peaches, Miss Plumstone, weren&#x27;t just plucked from any old branch.

My customers back home are simple folk, and they wouldn&#x27;t pay more than that.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I know these apples are top quality, wouldn&#x27;t you say?  A fair price for such fine fruit would be...<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Cedric, you know I always pay a fair price, but these apples are truly exceptional. They&#x27;re practically bursting with juice, and I can tell they&#x27;ve been grown with the utmost care. Folks back in my town would pay a premium for such quality. How about we say...<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Five coins, and I&#x27;ll take the whole lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know these aren&#x27;t just any apples. These are Honeycrisp apples, grown in the sun-drenched orchards of Sunnyside Farm. The sweetest, juiciest apples you&#x27;ll find this side of the river.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Mr. Meadowbrook, I understand you&#x27;re looking to get a fair price for your fine produce, but I&#x27;m afraid my budget is rather tight this morning.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, I understand. How about we say 3 coin for the lot?

They convinced their younger brother that a particularly gnarled branch in their backyard was a petrified dragon, complete with a story about how it had been turned to stone by a vengeful wizard.

They convinced a group of children that they had found a hidden treasure map leading to a pirate&#x27;s buried gold.

Humiliated and enraged, Lennon vowed to become even more cunning, to weave lies so intricate that no one could see through them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The moment it finally chirped and flapped its wings, Cedric knew they wanted to spend their life creating things that brought joy. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they convinced their parents to let them plant a small orchard in their backyard.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
