It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

The way her mother&#x27;s voice rose and fell, the subtle shifts in her expression, the way she knew exactly when to hold firm and when to concede—it was a performance that captivated Della. From that day forward, Della mimicked their mother&#x27;s every move, practicing her haggling skills on unsuspecting neighbors.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck a handful of plums from their family&#x27;s stall. The guilt gnawed at Della, but the sweetness of the forbidden fruit was intoxicating. Della hid the evidence carefully, vowing never to steal again, but the thrill of transgression lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing a rare and valuable fruit, the elusive moon melon.

The farmer, impressed by Della&#x27;s sharp wit and unwavering determination, offered Della valuable advice on identifying ripe fruit, a lesson Della treasured.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them travel as a merchant. Leaving the familiarity of the marketplace was bittersweet, but Della was determined to carve their own path, to prove they were more than just their parents&#x27; daughter.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a band of thieves who attempted to steal their cart. Della, despite being outnumbered, fought back fiercely, her fear masked by a calm determination.

He tugged at her skirt, mimicking her haggling, and she ruffled his hair, a rare smile gracing her lips.  In that moment, he felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the approval he craved.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother set up their fruit stall at the market. He carefully arranged the apples, pears, and plums, striving for a symmetrical display that would entice customers.  When a woman complimented the arrangement, his chest swelled with a warmth that banished the usual knot of anxiety.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accidentally overcharged a customer for a basket of berries.  Shame washed over him as the woman pointed out his mistake, her words sharp and accusatory. He stammered an apology, his hands shaking as he refunded the extra coins, the incident leaving a deep scar on his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he took over the fruit stall while his mother was ill. He felt a surge of responsibility, a chance to prove his worth.  He worked tirelessly, his voice gaining confidence as he negotiated prices and charmed customers, but the fear of failure lingered like a shadow.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his mother to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but he persevered, driven by a burning desire to succeed on his own.  He returned with a small profit, a sense of accomplishment that fueled his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he invested his savings in a larger cart, adorned with brightly painted fruit motifs. He imagined it as a symbol of his growing success, a testament to his dedication and hard work.  But the cart remained mostly empty, a painful reminder of his struggle to attract customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he met a seasoned fruit merchant who offered him advice on pricing and marketing.

The way her mother&#x27;s voice rose and fell, the subtle shifts in her expression, the way she knew exactly when to hold firm and when to concede—it was a performance that captivated Della. From that day forward, Della mimicked their mother&#x27;s every move, practicing her haggling skills on unsuspecting neighbors.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck a handful of plums from their family&#x27;s stall.

The farmer, impressed by Della&#x27;s sharp wit and unwavering determination, offered Della valuable advice on identifying ripe fruit, a lesson Della treasured.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them travel as a merchant. Leaving the familiarity of the marketplace was bittersweet, but Della was determined to carve their own path, to prove they were more than just their parents&#x27; daughter.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a band of thieves who attempted to steal their cart.

The way her mother&#x27;s voice rose and fell, the subtle shifts in her expression, the way she knew exactly when to hold firm and when to concede—it was a performance that captivated Della. From that day forward, Della mimicked their mother&#x27;s every move, practicing her haggling skills on unsuspecting neighbors.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck a handful of plums from their family&#x27;s stall. The guilt gnawed at Della, but the sweetness of the forbidden fruit was intoxicating. Della hid the evidence carefully, vowing never to steal again, but the thrill of transgression lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing a rare and valuable fruit, the elusive moon melon. Della was consumed by the desire to find this mythical fruit, driven by a mix of curiosity and a yearning to prove their worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a notoriously difficult farmer, securing a large shipment of peaches at a bargain price. The farmer, impressed by Della&#x27;s sharp wit and unwavering determination, offered Della valuable advice on identifying ripe fruit, a lesson Della treasured.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them travel as a merchant. Leaving the familiarity of the marketplace was bittersweet, but Della was determined to carve their own path, to prove they were more than just their parents&#x27; daughter.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a band of thieves who attempted to steal their cart. Della, despite being outnumbered, fought back fiercely, her fear masked by a calm determination. The thieves, surprised by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually fled, leaving Della shaken but resolute.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He tugged at her skirt, mimicking her haggling, and she ruffled his hair, a rare smile gracing her lips.  In that moment, he felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the approval he craved.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother set up their fruit stall at the market. He carefully arranged the apples, pears, and plums, striving for a symmetrical display that would entice customers.  When a woman complimented the arrangement, his chest swelled with a warmth that banished the usual knot of anxiety.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accidentally overcharged a customer for a basket of berries.  Shame washed over him as the woman pointed out his mistake, her words sharp and accusatory. He stammered an apology, his hands shaking as he refunded the extra coins, the incident leaving a deep scar on his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he took over the fruit stall while his mother was ill. He felt a surge of responsibility, a chance to prove his worth.  He worked tirelessly, his voice gaining confidence as he negotiated prices and charmed customers, but the fear of failure lingered like a shadow.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his mother to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but he persevered, driven by a burning desire to succeed on his own.  He returned with a small profit, a sense of accomplishment that fueled his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he invested his savings in a larger cart, adorned with brightly painted fruit motifs. He imagined it as a symbol of his growing success, a testament to his dedication and hard work.  But the cart remained mostly empty, a painful reminder of his struggle to attract customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he met a seasoned fruit merchant who offered him advice on pricing and marketing.  He listened intently, soaking up every word, desperate for any guidance that might lead him to the validation he so desperately sought.

Cedric realized then that stories could be as valuable as coins.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a group of children that a particularly knobby apple was a magical fruit that granted wishes.

Cedric felt a thrill course through him, a mix of guilt and excitement.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard two merchants arguing over the origin of a shipment of pears.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The way her mother&#x27;s voice rose and fell, the subtle shifts in her expression, the way she knew exactly when to hold firm and when to concede—it was a performance that captivated Della. From that day forward, Della mimicked their mother&#x27;s every move, practicing her haggling skills on unsuspecting neighbors.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck a handful of plums from their family&#x27;s stall. The guilt gnawed at Della, but the sweetness of the forbidden fruit was intoxicating. Della hid the evidence carefully, vowing never to steal again, but the thrill of transgression lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing a rare and valuable fruit, the elusive moon melon. Della was consumed by the desire to find this mythical fruit, driven by a mix of curiosity and a yearning to prove their worth.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they successfully negotiated a deal with a notoriously difficult farmer, securing a large shipment of peaches at a bargain price. The farmer, impressed by Della&#x27;s sharp wit and unwavering determination, offered Della valuable advice on identifying ripe fruit, a lesson Della treasured.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they finally convinced their parents to let them travel as a merchant. Leaving the familiarity of the marketplace was bittersweet, but Della was determined to carve their own path, to prove they were more than just their parents&#x27; daughter.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a band of thieves who attempted to steal their cart. Della, despite being outnumbered, fought back fiercely, her fear masked by a calm determination. The thieves, surprised by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually fled, leaving Della shaken but resolute.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He tugged at her skirt, mimicking her haggling, and she ruffled his hair, a rare smile gracing her lips.  In that moment, he felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the approval he craved.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother set up their fruit stall at the market. He carefully arranged the apples, pears, and plums, striving for a symmetrical display that would entice customers.  When a woman complimented the arrangement, his chest swelled with a warmth that banished the usual knot of anxiety.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accidentally overcharged a customer for a basket of berries.  Shame washed over him as the woman pointed out his mistake, her words sharp and accusatory. He stammered an apology, his hands shaking as he refunded the extra coins, the incident leaving a deep scar on his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he took over the fruit stall while his mother was ill. He felt a surge of responsibility, a chance to prove his worth.  He worked tirelessly, his voice gaining confidence as he negotiated prices and charmed customers, but the fear of failure lingered like a shadow.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his mother to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but he persevered, driven by a burning desire to succeed on his own.  He returned with a small profit, a sense of accomplishment that fueled his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he invested his savings in a larger cart, adorned with brightly painted fruit motifs. He imagined it as a symbol of his growing success, a testament to his dedication and hard work.  But the cart remained mostly empty, a painful reminder of his struggle to attract customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he met a seasoned fruit merchant who offered him advice on pricing and marketing.  He listened intently, soaking up every word, desperate for any guidance that might lead him to the validation he so desperately sought. The merchant&#x27;s words offered a glimmer of hope, a potential path towards the recognition he craved.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The baker, a jovial man with flour dusting his apron, seemed genuinely pleased with the exchange. Cedric realized then that stories could be as valuable as coins.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a group of children that a particularly knobby apple was a magical fruit that granted wishes. He traded it for a shiny marble, his first successful trade based purely on fabrication. Cedric felt a thrill course through him, a mix of guilt and excitement.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard two merchants arguing over the origin of a shipment of pears. Seizing the opportunity, Cedric claimed the pears were from his family orchard, a place that existed only in his imagination. The merchants, impressed by his tale, paid a premium price. Cedric realized the power of a good story to manipulate even the most discerning minds.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to trade him a crate of bruised peaches for a worn-out saddle. Cedric spun a tale of a daring escape from bandits, claiming the saddle was a relic of his adventure. The farmer, captivated by the story, readily agreed. Cedric felt a pang of guilt, but the thrill of the con outweighed it.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he set up his own stall at the local market, selling fruit he&#x27;d acquired through a series of clever trades. He embellished the stories behind each piece, weaving tales of exotic origins and miraculous properties. The customers flocked to his stall, eager to purchase a piece of his fabricated world. Cedric reveled in the attention, his confidence growing with every sale.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a distant town, his wagon laden with fruit from various markets. He spun elaborate tales of perilous journeys and treacherous landscapes, captivating the locals with his charisma and storytelling prowess. Cedric realized he was becoming a master of deception, his lies as intricate and alluring as the fruit he sold.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

I&#x27;d let you have &#x27;em for 3 coins a bushel, but considering their exceptional quality, 4 coins would be a steal.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, I&#x27;m looking to buy a good amount of fruit today.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, my friend, you&#x27;ve come to the right place! Today&#x27;s harvest is simply divine. These pears, for example, are the juiciest, sweetest you&#x27;ll find in all of Fruitville.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

He tugged at her skirt, mimicking her haggling, and she ruffled his hair, a rare smile gracing her lips.  In that moment, he felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the approval he craved.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother set up their fruit stall at the market. He carefully arranged the apples, pears, and plums, striving for a symmetrical display that would entice customers.

He returned with a small profit, a sense of accomplishment that fueled his ambition.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he invested his savings in a larger cart, adorned with brightly painted fruit motifs.

The baker, a jovial man with flour dusting his apron, seemed genuinely pleased with the exchange. Cedric realized then that stories could be as valuable as coins.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced a group of children that a particularly knobby apple was a magical fruit that granted wishes. He traded it for a shiny marble, his first successful trade based purely on fabrication. Cedric felt a thrill course through him, a mix of guilt and excitement.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard two merchants arguing over the origin of a shipment of pears. Seizing the opportunity, Cedric claimed the pears were from his family orchard, a place that existed only in his imagination. The merchants, impressed by his tale, paid a premium price. Cedric realized the power of a good story to manipulate even the most discerning minds.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to trade him a crate of bruised peaches for a worn-out saddle.

Cedric reveled in the attention, his confidence growing with every sale.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a distant town, his wagon laden with fruit from various markets. He spun elaborate tales of perilous journeys and treacherous landscapes, captivating the locals with his charisma and storytelling prowess. Cedric realized he was becoming a master of deception, his lies as intricate and alluring as the fruit he sold.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
