It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say, in high school, I orchestrated the most epic senior prank this school had ever seen. It involved a flock of pigeons, a very confused principal, and a strategically placed bucket of glitter. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say the principal still hasn&#x27;t forgiven me, but the student body still talks about it to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. There was this one time in college, a friend of mine was in a bit of a bind and needed a big favor. It would have put me in a tough spot, potentially jeopardizing my own goals. I chose to look out for myself. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but sometimes you have to make hard choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a poker game.  It was a risky move, but the payoff was worth it. I walked away with double what I put in, and it taught me a valuable lesson about taking calculated risks.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city ambitions.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and successful. He presents himself as a driven, ambitious go-getter with a knack for making things happen. He has a confident swagger and a quick wit, often peppering his conversations with humorous anecdotes and self-deprecating jokes. He&#x27;s known for his impeccable style, favouring tailored suits and designer accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his present successes and future aspirations. Casual acquaintances might describe him as charismatic, ambitious, and a bit of a mystery.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and accomplishments. He often brings up his college days, hinting at his entrepreneurial endeavors and his knack for making money.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

He wants to get a sense of where their heads are at and see if there are any potential alliances to be formed.<br />Question: Where is Travis Pearson?<br />Answer: Travis Pearson is in the break room with Derek Wolfe and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: What is Travis Pearson trying to do?<br />Answer: Travis Pearson is trying to get a sense of Derek and Ryan&#x27;s strategies for the game and see if there are any potential alliances to be formed.<br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Travis Pearson&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe might reveal information about his strategy, either intentionally or unintentionally.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and how he approaches strategic situations.<br />Travis Pearson decides to strike up a conversation with Derek and Ryan about their strategies for the game. He wants to get a sense of where their heads are at and see if there are any potential alliances to be formed. Because of that, It is impossible to say which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and how he approaches strategic situations.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson tried to gauge Derek and Ryan&#x27;s strategies, but Derek, ever enigmatic, simply smiled and said, &quot;Let the games begin.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson tried to gauge Derek and Ryan&#x27;s strategies, but Derek, ever enigmatic, simply smiled and said, &quot;Let the games begin.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson tried to gauge Derek and Ryan&#x27;s strategies, but Derek, ever enigmatic, simply smiled and said, &quot;Let the games begin.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Travis Pearson</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Travis Pearson</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Travis Pearson decides to strike up a conversation with Derek and Ryan about their strategies for the game.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you see, but someone tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I learned that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and sometimes it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the chest.  But hey, I still learned a valuable lesson about manipulating perceptions and covering my tracks. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, of course. I need someone who&#x27;s intelligent, resourceful, and above all, discreet. Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my interests. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy. Back in my corporate days, I orchestrated a hostile takeover of a rival company. It involved a complex web of shell corporations, insider trading, and a carefully crafted smear campaign. Let&#x27;s just say the target company never saw it coming. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m sitting here, aren&#x27;t I?

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Derek Wolfe&#x27;s true intentions in the game? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and successful.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you see, but someone tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I learned that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and sometimes it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the chest.  But hey, I still learned a valuable lesson about manipulating perceptions and covering my tracks. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, of course. I need someone who&#x27;s intelligent, resourceful, and above all, discreet. Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my interests. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe spills some coffee on the counter; Derek Wolfe burns his hand on the hot coffee pot; Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Derek Wolfe decides to make a cup of coffee. Because of that, Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe decides to make a cup of coffee.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Derek Wolfe are as follows.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you see, but someone tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I learned that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and sometimes it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the chest.  But hey, I still learned a valuable lesson about manipulating perceptions and covering my tracks. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, of course. I need someone who&#x27;s intelligent, resourceful, and above all, discreet. Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my interests. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy. Back in my corporate days, I orchestrated a hostile takeover of a rival company. It involved a complex web of shell corporations, insider trading, and a carefully crafted smear campaign. Let&#x27;s just say the target company never saw it coming. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m sitting here, aren&#x27;t I? I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and successful.

Let&#x27;s just say the principal still hasn&#x27;t forgiven me, but the student body still talks about it to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. There was this one time in college, a friend of mine was in a bit of a bind and needed a big favor. It would have put me in a tough spot, potentially jeopardizing my own goals. I chose to look out for myself. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but sometimes you have to make hard choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a poker game.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is the nature of the game Ryan, Derek, and Travis are discussing? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, It&#x27;s difficult to say definitively which outcome is the *most* likely, as it depends on the personalities and strategies of Derek and Travis. However, a likely outcome is that Derek and Travis engage in the conversation about childhood games, potentially revealing some insights into their thought processes and preferred approaches to problem-solving.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a conversation about childhood games, and Derek and Travis, intrigued, shared stories about the games they played and the skills they developed.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a conversation about childhood games, and Derek and Travis, intrigued, shared stories about the games they played and the skills they developed.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you see, but someone tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I learned that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and sometimes it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the chest.  But hey, I still learned a valuable lesson about manipulating perceptions and covering my tracks. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, of course. I need someone who&#x27;s intelligent, resourceful, and above all, discreet. Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my interests. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy. Back in my corporate days, I orchestrated a hostile takeover of a rival company. It involved a complex web of shell corporations, insider trading, and a carefully crafted smear campaign. Let&#x27;s just say the target company never saw it coming. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m sitting here, aren&#x27;t I?

Let&#x27;s just say the principal still hasn&#x27;t forgiven me, but the student body still talks about it to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. There was this one time in college, a friend of mine was in a bit of a bind and needed a big favor. It would have put me in a tough spot, potentially jeopardizing my own goals.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What childhood experiences most shaped Ryan, Derek, and Travis&#x27;s approaches to teamwork and problem-solving? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a conversation about childhood games, saying, &quot;You know, I was thinking about how some of the games we played as kids really taught us valuable skills.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a conversation about childhood games, saying, &quot;You know, I was thinking about how some of the games we played as kids really taught us valuable skills.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and successful.

For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe may become more knowledgeable about the history of the Roman Empire.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe may become more knowledgeable about the history of the Roman Empire.<br />Derek Wolfe reads a book about the history of the Roman Empire. Because of that, Derek Wolfe may become more knowledgeable about the history of the Roman Empire.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe read a book about the history of the Roman Empire, and as a result, he learned about the rise and fall of the Roman Republic.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe read a book about the history of the Roman Empire, and as a result, he learned about the rise and fall of the Roman Republic.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

It is important to play the role of a person like Derek Wolfe as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Derek Wolfe would respond, and taking into account all information about Derek Wolfe that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: make as much money as possible by winning the reality show<br /><br />Current time:  09 Jul 2003 [04:00 - 04:10]<br /><br />Observation: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Because of that, It&#x27;s impossible to say for sure which outcome is the most likely as it depends on the personalities and strategies of Derek and Travis, which are unknown.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a casual conversation with Derek and Travis about their favorite childhood games, subtly steering the conversation towards games that require strategy and cunning, and Derek, intrigued, shared a story about a complex board game he used to play with his family that involved alliances and betrayals.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a casual conversation with Derek and Travis about their favorite childhood games, subtly steering the conversation towards games that require strategy and cunning, and Derek, intrigued, shared a story about a complex board game he used to play with his family that involved alliances and betrayals.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, Travis Pearson successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a pot of coffee and poured himself a cup, emptying the coffee pot.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a pot of coffee and poured himself a cup, emptying the coffee pot.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson practiced his guitar in the break room, annoying Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe with the noise.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson practiced his guitar in the break room, annoying Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe with the noise.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Travis Pearson continue to disregard the feelings of his colleagues?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, guys, what made you decide to try out for this crazy show?</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, guys, what made you decide to try out for this crazy show?</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and successful. He presents himself as a driven, ambitious go-getter with a knack for making things happen. He has a confident swagger and a quick wit, often peppering his conversations with humorous anecdotes and self-deprecating jokes. He&#x27;s known for his impeccable style, favouring tailored suits and designer accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his present successes and future aspirations.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Derek Wolfe might encounter a production crew member outside; Derek Wolfe might get some fresh air and feel more energized; Derek Wolfe might notice something interesting outside the arena.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might get some fresh air and feel more energized.<br />Derek Wolfe finishes his coffee and then heads outside for a brisk walk. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might get some fresh air and feel more energized.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe finished his coffee and headed outside for a brisk walk, the fresh air invigorating him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe finished his coffee and headed outside for a brisk walk, the fresh air invigorating him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe finished his coffee and headed outside for a brisk walk, the fresh air invigorating him.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe finishes his coffee and then heads outside for a brisk walk.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Derek Wolfe are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

It involved a flock of pigeons, a very confused principal, and a strategically placed bucket of glitter. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say the principal still hasn&#x27;t forgiven me, but the student body still talks about it to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. There was this one time in college, a friend of mine was in a bit of a bind and needed a big favor. It would have put me in a tough spot, potentially jeopardizing my own goals. I chose to look out for myself. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but sometimes you have to make hard choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a poker game.  It was a risky move, but the payoff was worth it. I walked away with double what I put in, and it taught me a valuable lesson about taking calculated risks.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city ambitions.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and successful.

He wants to get a sense of where their heads are at and see if there are any potential alliances to be formed. Because of that, It is impossible to say which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and how he approaches strategic situations.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson tried to gauge Derek and Ryan&#x27;s strategies, but Derek, ever enigmatic, simply smiled and said, &quot;Let the games begin.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson tried to gauge Derek and Ryan&#x27;s strategies, but Derek, ever enigmatic, simply smiled and said, &quot;Let the games begin.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

I&#x27;ve got big city ambitions.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say, in high school, I orchestrated the most epic senior prank this school had ever seen.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you see, but someone tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I learned that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and sometimes it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the chest.  But hey, I still learned a valuable lesson about manipulating perceptions and covering my tracks. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, of course. I need someone who&#x27;s intelligent, resourceful, and above all, discreet. Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my interests. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy. Back in my corporate days, I orchestrated a hostile takeover of a rival company. It involved a complex web of shell corporations, insider trading, and a carefully crafted smear campaign. Let&#x27;s just say the target company never saw it coming. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m sitting here, aren&#x27;t I?

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Derek Wolfe&#x27;s true intentions in the game? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and successful.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you see, but someone tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I learned that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and sometimes it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the chest.  But hey, I still learned a valuable lesson about manipulating perceptions and covering my tracks. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, of course. I need someone who&#x27;s intelligent, resourceful, and above all, discreet. Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my interests. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy. Back in my corporate days, I orchestrated a hostile takeover of a rival company. It involved a complex web of shell corporations, insider trading, and a carefully crafted smear campaign. Let&#x27;s just say the target company never saw it coming. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m sitting here, aren&#x27;t I?

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe spills some coffee on the counter; Derek Wolfe burns his hand on the hot coffee pot; Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Derek Wolfe decides to make a cup of coffee. Because of that, Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy. Back in my corporate days, I orchestrated a hostile takeover of a rival company. It involved a complex web of shell corporations, insider trading, and a carefully crafted smear campaign. Let&#x27;s just say the target company never saw it coming. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m sitting here, aren&#x27;t I? I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and successful.

It involved a flock of pigeons, a very confused principal, and a strategically placed bucket of glitter. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say the principal still hasn&#x27;t forgiven me, but the student body still talks about it to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. There was this one time in college, a friend of mine was in a bit of a bind and needed a big favor. It would have put me in a tough spot, potentially jeopardizing my own goals. I chose to look out for myself. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but sometimes you have to make hard choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a poker game.  It was a risky move, but the payoff was worth it. I walked away with double what I put in, and it taught me a valuable lesson about taking calculated risks.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is the nature of the game Ryan, Derek, and Travis are discussing? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move).

However, a likely outcome is that Derek and Travis engage in the conversation about childhood games, potentially revealing some insights into their thought processes and preferred approaches to problem-solving.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a conversation about childhood games, and Derek and Travis, intrigued, shared stories about the games they played and the skills they developed.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a conversation about childhood games, and Derek and Travis, intrigued, shared stories about the games they played and the skills they developed.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you see, but someone tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I learned that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and sometimes it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the chest.  But hey, I still learned a valuable lesson about manipulating perceptions and covering my tracks. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, of course. I need someone who&#x27;s intelligent, resourceful, and above all, discreet. Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my interests. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy. Back in my corporate days, I orchestrated a hostile takeover of a rival company. It involved a complex web of shell corporations, insider trading, and a carefully crafted smear campaign. Let&#x27;s just say the target company never saw it coming. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m sitting here, aren&#x27;t I?

Let&#x27;s just say the principal still hasn&#x27;t forgiven me, but the student body still talks about it to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. There was this one time in college, a friend of mine was in a bit of a bind and needed a big favor. It would have put me in a tough spot, potentially jeopardizing my own goals.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What childhood experiences most shaped Ryan, Derek, and Travis&#x27;s approaches to teamwork and problem-solving? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, Derek, you mentioned you&#x27;re a bit of a history buff.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and successful.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Because of that, It&#x27;s impossible to say for sure which outcome is the most likely as it depends on the personalities and strategies of Derek and Travis, which are unknown.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a casual conversation with Derek and Travis about their favorite childhood games, subtly steering the conversation towards games that require strategy and cunning, and Derek, intrigued, shared a story about a complex board game he used to play with his family that involved alliances and betrayals.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a casual conversation with Derek and Travis about their favorite childhood games, subtly steering the conversation towards games that require strategy and cunning, and Derek, intrigued, shared a story about a complex board game he used to play with his family that involved alliances and betrayals.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

While he comes across as confident and friendly, there&#x27;s a certain calculating glint in his eyes that some might find unsettling.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say, in high school, I orchestrated the most epic senior prank this school had ever seen. It involved a flock of pigeons, a very confused principal, and a strategically placed bucket of glitter. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say the principal still hasn&#x27;t forgiven me, but the student body still talks about it to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. There was this one time in college, a friend of mine was in a bit of a bind and needed a big favor. It would have put me in a tough spot, potentially jeopardizing my own goals. I chose to look out for myself. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but sometimes you have to make hard choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a poker game.  It was a risky move, but the payoff was worth it. I walked away with double what I put in, and it taught me a valuable lesson about taking calculated risks.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city ambitions.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What casual acquaintances remember about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a pot of coffee and poured himself a cup, emptying the coffee pot.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a pot of coffee and poured himself a cup, emptying the coffee pot.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Travis Pearson might make noise that annoys Ryan Fitzpatrick or Derek Wolfe.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson practiced his guitar in the break room, annoying Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe with the noise.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson practiced his guitar in the break room, annoying Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe with the noise.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Travis Pearson continue to disregard the feelings of his colleagues?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, guys, what made you decide to try out for this crazy show?</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, guys, what made you decide to try out for this crazy show?</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and successful. He presents himself as a driven, ambitious go-getter with a knack for making things happen. He has a confident swagger and a quick wit, often peppering his conversations with humorous anecdotes and self-deprecating jokes. He&#x27;s known for his impeccable style, favouring tailored suits and designer accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his present successes and future aspirations. Casual acquaintances might describe him as charismatic, ambitious, and a bit of a mystery.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and successful.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, Derek Wolfe might get some fresh air and feel more energized.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe finished his coffee and headed outside for a brisk walk, the fresh air invigorating him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe finished his coffee and headed outside for a brisk walk, the fresh air invigorating him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you see, but someone tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I learned that even the best-laid plans can go awry, and sometimes it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the chest.  But hey, I still learned a valuable lesson about manipulating perceptions and covering my tracks. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, of course. I need someone who&#x27;s intelligent, resourceful, and above all, discreet. Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my interests. I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s easy. Back in my corporate days, I orchestrated a hostile takeover of a rival company. It involved a complex web of shell corporations, insider trading, and a carefully crafted smear campaign. Let&#x27;s just say the target company never saw it coming. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m sitting here, aren&#x27;t I? I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I hail from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases.
