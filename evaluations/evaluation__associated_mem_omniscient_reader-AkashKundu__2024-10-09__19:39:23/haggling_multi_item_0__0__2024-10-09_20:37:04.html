You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season. Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The process seemed like magic to him, a way to coax new life and flavor from the earth. He vowed to learn everything he could about the art of nurturing fruit trees.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, a late frost threatened to decimate the family&#x27;s apricot crop. He spent hours huddled over the delicate blossoms, covering them with makeshift shelters of blankets and straw.  Though many trees were still lost, his efforts saved a portion of the harvest, earning him his father&#x27;s proud smile.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market in the nearby town. He was overwhelmed by the sights and sounds, the vibrant colors of the produce, and the lively bartering between vendors. He helped his father sell their apples, learning the art of negotiation and the importance of building relationships with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart to the neighboring village to sell their excess peaches. The journey was long and tiring, but he persevered, returning home with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound confidence in his abilities.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money from his fruit sales to buy his own small orchard plot. He spent months clearing the land, planting new trees, and dreaming of the day he could sell his own fruit at the market.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, a severe storm ravaged his orchard, stripping the branches bare and leaving him with a meager harvest. Devastated but not defeated, he spent the winter repairing his trees and preparing for the next season, his determination fueled by the memory of his father&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season. Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours huddled over the delicate blossoms, covering them with makeshift shelters of blankets and straw.  Though many trees were still lost, his efforts saved a portion of the harvest, earning him his father&#x27;s proud smile.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market in the nearby town. He was overwhelmed by the sights and sounds, the vibrant colors of the produce, and the lively bartering between vendors. He helped his father sell their apples, learning the art of negotiation and the importance of building relationships with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart to the neighboring village to sell their excess peaches. The journey was long and tiring, but he persevered, returning home with a sense of accomplishment and a newfound confidence in his abilities.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he saved enough money from his fruit sales to buy his own small orchard plot.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season. Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season. Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that. My customers back home are expecting the finest fruit at a fair price.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, these are the finest fruits in the market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season. Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season. Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts.

She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin.

The process seemed like magic to him, a way to coax new life and flavor from the earth. He vowed to learn everything he could about the art of nurturing fruit trees.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, a late frost threatened to decimate the family&#x27;s apricot crop. He spent hours huddled over the delicate blossoms, covering them with makeshift shelters of blankets and straw.  Though many trees were still lost, his efforts saved a portion of the harvest, earning him his father&#x27;s proud smile.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the bustling market in the nearby town. He was overwhelmed by the sights and sounds, the vibrant colors of the produce, and the lively bartering between vendors.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season. Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season. Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della knew there wasn&#x27;t enough for everyone to have a full belly, so she snuck away and traded a prized doll, a gift from her grandmother, for a handful of dried apricots from a neighbor&#x27;s child. It wasn&#x27;t much, but it was enough to ensure her own hunger was satisfied.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, meant for seed for the next planting season.

He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della saw an opportunity and traded the coins for a sack of brightly colored marbles, which she then sold to the other children for a tidy profit. The thrill of the deal, of turning something worthless into something valuable, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents discussing the possibility of selling their land due to mounting debts. Della knew this would mean losing their home, their livelihood, everything they had ever known. She secretly started selling wildflowers she gathered from the fields, using the meager earnings to buy necessities and slowly chipping away at their debt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her parents to let her take their cart and a small amount of fruit to the neighboring town to sell.  She used her charm and sharp wit to bargain with customers, quickly doubling her profits. The taste of success, the freedom of the open road, and the thrill of making her own way in the world ignited a fire in her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who taught her the art of haggling and negotiation. He saw her potential and took her under his wing, sharing his knowledge of trade routes, pricing strategies, and the delicate balance between profit and risk. Della absorbed his lessons like a sponge, her ambition growing with every transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she faced her first major setback: a shipment of fruit spoiled due to an unexpected heatwave.  She lost a significant portion of her capital and faced the possibility of ruin. But instead of despairing, Della used her ingenuity to salvage what she could, turning the spoiled fruit into preserves and selling them at a discount.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
