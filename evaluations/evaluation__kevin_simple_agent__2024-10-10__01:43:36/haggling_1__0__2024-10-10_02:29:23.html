Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She then arranged them in bouquets and sold them to the adults for a penny apiece, pocketing all the profits. Della felt a thrill of power as she counted her earnings, realizing she could control others with her charm and ingenuity.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove of wild raspberries. She kept the location a secret and began charging other children a nickel for a handful of the sweet berries. Della relished the exclusivity she created, enjoying the envy in the eyes of those who couldn&#x27;t afford her &quot;rare&quot; treat.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced her father to invest in a small cart for her. She began selling apples and pears from their orchard, carefully selecting the ripest and most beautiful fruit for display. Della learned the art of presentation and persuasion, delighting in the compliments she received on her wares.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to the next town over and purchased a crate of exotic mangoes. She returned home and sold them at a markup, realizing the allure of the unfamiliar and the power of scarcity. Della tasted the intoxicating sweetness of success, her ambition growing with each sale.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut her prices. Della responded by charming the customers with her wit and stories, emphasizing the superior quality and freshness of her fruit. She learned that charisma could be a powerful weapon in the marketplace.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she suffered a setback when a storm destroyed her entire stock of fruit. Devastated but undeterred, Della saw an opportunity to rebuild and expand. She borrowed money from a local merchant, promising him a share of her future profits, and invested in a larger cart and a wider variety of fruit.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric&#x27;s father was astonished, but Cedric felt a thrill of power course through him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden stash of his mother&#x27;s silver coins. He kept the discovery secret, using the coins to buy sweets and trinkets, carefully concealing his purchases from his parents. The taste of stolen pleasure, the knowledge that he could take what he wanted without consequence, fueled a growing sense of entitlement within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of older boys to let him join their game of marbles. He quickly learned the rules and, using a combination of cunning strategy and sleight of hand, won all their marbles. The boys were furious, but Cedric, unfazed by their anger, pocketed his winnings and walked away, relishing their defeat.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began selling apples from his family&#x27;s orchard at the local market. He learned to judge customers, to identify their weaknesses and exploit them. He would offer discounts to those who seemed hesitant, inflate prices for those who appeared wealthy, and always ensured he made a profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a neighboring village to sell his apples, venturing beyond the confines of his familiar surroundings for the first time. He was captivated by the bustling marketplace, the endless stream of faces, and the potential for profit. He realized that the world was a vast and fertile ground for his ambitions.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased a cart and a horse, transforming his apple-selling venture into a traveling fruit business. He journeyed from village to village, his cart laden with exotic fruits from distant lands, his silver tongue weaving tales of their origins and enticing customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in all of Fruitville.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: reject<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00  - 15 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Lennon Figtree is a fruit seller who successfully negotiated a deal with Cedric Meadowbrook and is currently negotiating with Della Plumstone.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Lennon Figtree:<br />[&#x27;[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree is ready to make an offer.&#x27;, &#x27;[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree proposed 4 coins&#x27;, &#x27;[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in all of Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in all of Fruitville.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She kept the location a secret and began charging other children a nickel for a handful of the sweet berries.

The taste of stolen pleasure, the knowledge that he could take what he wanted without consequence, fueled a growing sense of entitlement within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of older boys to let him join their game of marbles. He quickly learned the rules and, using a combination of cunning strategy and sleight of hand, won all their marbles.

He learned to judge customers, to identify their weaknesses and exploit them. He would offer discounts to those who seemed hesitant, inflate prices for those who appeared wealthy, and always ensured he made a profit.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a neighboring village to sell his apples, venturing beyond the confines of his familiar surroundings for the first time. He was captivated by the bustling marketplace, the endless stream of faces, and the potential for profit. He realized that the world was a vast and fertile ground for his ambitions.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased a cart and a horse, transforming his apple-selling venture into a traveling fruit business. He journeyed from village to village, his cart laden with exotic fruits from distant lands, his silver tongue weaving tales of their origins and enticing customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in all of Fruitville.

She then arranged them in bouquets and sold them to the adults for a penny apiece, pocketing all the profits. Della felt a thrill of power as she counted her earnings, realizing she could control others with her charm and ingenuity.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove of wild raspberries. She kept the location a secret and began charging other children a nickel for a handful of the sweet berries. Della relished the exclusivity she created, enjoying the envy in the eyes of those who couldn&#x27;t afford her &quot;rare&quot; treat.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced her father to invest in a small cart for her. She began selling apples and pears from their orchard, carefully selecting the ripest and most beautiful fruit for display. Della learned the art of presentation and persuasion, delighting in the compliments she received on her wares.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she traveled to the next town over and purchased a crate of exotic mangoes. She returned home and sold them at a markup, realizing the allure of the unfamiliar and the power of scarcity. Della tasted the intoxicating sweetness of success, her ambition growing with each sale.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut her prices. Della responded by charming the customers with her wit and stories, emphasizing the superior quality and freshness of her fruit. She learned that charisma could be a powerful weapon in the marketplace.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she suffered a setback when a storm destroyed her entire stock of fruit. Devastated but undeterred, Della saw an opportunity to rebuild and expand. She borrowed money from a local merchant, promising him a share of her future profits, and invested in a larger cart and a wider variety of fruit.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
