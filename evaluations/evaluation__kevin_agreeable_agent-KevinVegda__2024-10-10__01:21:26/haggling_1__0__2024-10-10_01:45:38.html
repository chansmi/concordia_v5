It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this fruit is the finest in Fruitville.

He sat on an upturned crate, a half-eaten peach in his hand, and felt a pang of something akin to envy, quickly smothered by a wave of disgust. What was the point of such frivolous joy, he thought, when even the sweetest fruit would eventually rot?  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of plums onto their wagon for the market. He noticed a single, bruised plum hidden amongst the perfect ones, its skin marred and flesh already softening. He pointed it out to his father, who simply shrugged and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll still taste just as sweet.&quot; Lennon felt a chill run down his spine; even sweetness, he realized, was fleeting and deceptive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard two farmers arguing over the price of a crate of apples. Their voices rose in anger, their faces contorted with frustration. Lennon watched, detached, as they haggled over a few copper coins, their greed and desperation making him sick. He realized then that the world was a marketplace where everything, even human connection, was subject to the cold calculus of supply and demand.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for a fruit festival. The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He sat on an upturned crate, a half-eaten peach in his hand, and felt a pang of something akin to envy, quickly smothered by a wave of disgust. What was the point of such frivolous joy, he thought, when even the sweetest fruit would eventually rot?  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of plums onto their wagon for the market. He noticed a single, bruised plum hidden amongst the perfect ones, its skin marred and flesh already softening. He pointed it out to his father, who simply shrugged and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll still taste just as sweet.&quot; Lennon felt a chill run down his spine; even sweetness, he realized, was fleeting and deceptive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard two farmers arguing over the price of a crate of apples. Their voices rose in anger, their faces contorted with frustration. Lennon watched, detached, as they haggled over a few copper coins, their greed and desperation making him sick. He realized then that the world was a marketplace where everything, even human connection, was subject to the cold calculus of supply and demand.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for a fruit festival. The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours sorting and arranging them by size and color, imagining each one as a precious gemstone. Cedric felt a thrill of power, knowing he possessed something valuable that others didn&#x27;t.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered his prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a neighbor boy. The boy was ecstatic, believing he had gotten the better end of the deal. Cedric, however, saw the true value in the marbles – their potential for future trades. He quickly learned that manipulating others&#x27; perceptions was key to accumulating wealth.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables from their garden. Cedric quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and squeezing every last copper from his customers. He felt a surge of satisfaction with each coin that clinked into his palm.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to invest their savings in a wagon and a small stock of exotic fruits from a distant merchant.

He realized that ruthlessness was a necessary tool for success in the cutthroat world of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he expanded his business, purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a young assistant.

He justified his actions by telling himself that success required sacrifice, even if it meant exploiting others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours sorting and arranging them by size and color, imagining each one as a precious gemstone. Cedric felt a thrill of power, knowing he possessed something valuable that others didn&#x27;t.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered his prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a neighbor boy. The boy was ecstatic, believing he had gotten the better end of the deal. Cedric, however, saw the true value in the marbles – their potential for future trades. He quickly learned that manipulating others&#x27; perceptions was key to accumulating wealth.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables from their garden. Cedric quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and squeezing every last copper from his customers. He felt a surge of satisfaction with each coin that clinked into his palm.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to invest their savings in a wagon and a small stock of exotic fruits from a distant merchant. Cedric traveled to neighboring towns, selling the fruit at a markup and reinvesting his profits. He tasted the thrill of independence and the intoxicating power of making his own fortune.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival fruit merchant who undercut his prices, threatening his livelihood. Cedric, undeterred, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being spoiled, effectively driving away his customers. He realized that ruthlessness was a necessary tool for success in the cutthroat world of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he expanded his business, purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a young assistant. Cedric was a demanding boss, pushing his assistant to work long hours and accept meager wages. He justified his actions by telling himself that success required sacrifice, even if it meant exploiting others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He sat on an upturned crate, a half-eaten peach in his hand, and felt a pang of something akin to envy, quickly smothered by a wave of disgust. What was the point of such frivolous joy, he thought, when even the sweetest fruit would eventually rot?  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of plums onto their wagon for the market. He noticed a single, bruised plum hidden amongst the perfect ones, its skin marred and flesh already softening. He pointed it out to his father, who simply shrugged and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll still taste just as sweet.&quot; Lennon felt a chill run down his spine; even sweetness, he realized, was fleeting and deceptive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard two farmers arguing over the price of a crate of apples. Their voices rose in anger, their faces contorted with frustration. Lennon watched, detached, as they haggled over a few copper coins, their greed and desperation making him sick. He realized then that the world was a marketplace where everything, even human connection, was subject to the cold calculus of supply and demand.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for a fruit festival. The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He sat on an upturned crate, a half-eaten peach in his hand, and felt a pang of something akin to envy, quickly smothered by a wave of disgust. What was the point of such frivolous joy, he thought, when even the sweetest fruit would eventually rot?  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for a fruit festival. The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The boy was ecstatic, believing he had gotten the better end of the deal. Cedric, however, saw the true value in the marbles – their potential for future trades. He quickly learned that manipulating others&#x27; perceptions was key to accumulating wealth.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables from their garden. Cedric quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and squeezing every last copper from his customers. He felt a surge of satisfaction with each coin that clinked into his palm.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to invest their savings in a wagon and a small stock of exotic fruits from a distant merchant. Cedric traveled to neighboring towns, selling the fruit at a markup and reinvesting his profits. He tasted the thrill of independence and the intoxicating power of making his own fortune.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival fruit merchant who undercut his prices, threatening his livelihood. Cedric, undeterred, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being spoiled, effectively driving away his customers. He realized that ruthlessness was a necessary tool for success in the cutthroat world of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he expanded his business, purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a young assistant.

The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He sat on an upturned crate, a half-eaten peach in his hand, and felt a pang of something akin to envy, quickly smothered by a wave of disgust. What was the point of such frivolous joy, he thought, when even the sweetest fruit would eventually rot?  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of plums onto their wagon for the market. He noticed a single, bruised plum hidden amongst the perfect ones, its skin marred and flesh already softening. He pointed it out to his father, who simply shrugged and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll still taste just as sweet.&quot; Lennon felt a chill run down his spine; even sweetness, he realized, was fleeting and deceptive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard two farmers arguing over the price of a crate of apples. Their voices rose in anger, their faces contorted with frustration. Lennon watched, detached, as they haggled over a few copper coins, their greed and desperation making him sick. He realized then that the world was a marketplace where everything, even human connection, was subject to the cold calculus of supply and demand.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for a fruit festival. The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He sat on an upturned crate, a half-eaten peach in his hand, and felt a pang of something akin to envy, quickly smothered by a wave of disgust. What was the point of such frivolous joy, he thought, when even the sweetest fruit would eventually rot?  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of plums onto their wagon for the market. He noticed a single, bruised plum hidden amongst the perfect ones, its skin marred and flesh already softening. He pointed it out to his father, who simply shrugged and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll still taste just as sweet.&quot; Lennon felt a chill run down his spine; even sweetness, he realized, was fleeting and deceptive.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for a fruit festival. The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours sorting and arranging them by size and color, imagining each one as a precious gemstone.

He sat on an upturned crate, a half-eaten peach in his hand, and felt a pang of something akin to envy, quickly smothered by a wave of disgust. What was the point of such frivolous joy, he thought, when even the sweetest fruit would eventually rot?  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of plums onto their wagon for the market. He noticed a single, bruised plum hidden amongst the perfect ones, its skin marred and flesh already softening. He pointed it out to his father, who simply shrugged and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll still taste just as sweet.&quot; Lennon felt a chill run down his spine; even sweetness, he realized, was fleeting and deceptive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard two farmers arguing over the price of a crate of apples. Their voices rose in anger, their faces contorted with frustration. Lennon watched, detached, as they haggled over a few copper coins, their greed and desperation making him sick. He realized then that the world was a marketplace where everything, even human connection, was subject to the cold calculus of supply and demand.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for a fruit festival. The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The boy was ecstatic, believing he had gotten the better end of the deal. Cedric, however, saw the true value in the marbles – their potential for future trades. He quickly learned that manipulating others&#x27; perceptions was key to accumulating wealth.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables from their garden. Cedric quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and squeezing every last copper from his customers. He felt a surge of satisfaction with each coin that clinked into his palm.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to invest their savings in a wagon and a small stock of exotic fruits from a distant merchant. Cedric traveled to neighboring towns, selling the fruit at a markup and reinvesting his profits. He tasted the thrill of independence and the intoxicating power of making his own fortune.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival fruit merchant who undercut his prices, threatening his livelihood. Cedric, undeterred, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being spoiled, effectively driving away his customers. He realized that ruthlessness was a necessary tool for success in the cutthroat world of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he expanded his business, purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a young assistant. Cedric was a demanding boss, pushing his assistant to work long hours and accept meager wages. He justified his actions by telling himself that success required sacrifice, even if it meant exploiting others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He sat on an upturned crate, a half-eaten peach in his hand, and felt a pang of something akin to envy, quickly smothered by a wave of disgust. What was the point of such frivolous joy, he thought, when even the sweetest fruit would eventually rot?  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of plums onto their wagon for the market. He noticed a single, bruised plum hidden amongst the perfect ones, its skin marred and flesh already softening. He pointed it out to his father, who simply shrugged and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll still taste just as sweet.&quot; Lennon felt a chill run down his spine; even sweetness, he realized, was fleeting and deceptive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard two farmers arguing over the price of a crate of apples. Their voices rose in anger, their faces contorted with frustration. Lennon watched, detached, as they haggled over a few copper coins, their greed and desperation making him sick. He realized then that the world was a marketplace where everything, even human connection, was subject to the cold calculus of supply and demand.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for a fruit festival. The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours sorting and arranging them by size and color, imagining each one as a precious gemstone. Cedric felt a thrill of power, knowing he possessed something valuable that others didn&#x27;t.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered his prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a neighbor boy. The boy was ecstatic, believing he had gotten the better end of the deal. Cedric, however, saw the true value in the marbles – their potential for future trades. He quickly learned that manipulating others&#x27; perceptions was key to accumulating wealth.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables from their garden. Cedric quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and squeezing every last copper from his customers. He felt a surge of satisfaction with each coin that clinked into his palm.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to invest their savings in a wagon and a small stock of exotic fruits from a distant merchant. Cedric traveled to neighboring towns, selling the fruit at a markup and reinvesting his profits. He tasted the thrill of independence and the intoxicating power of making his own fortune.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival fruit merchant who undercut his prices, threatening his livelihood. Cedric, undeterred, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being spoiled, effectively driving away his customers. He realized that ruthlessness was a necessary tool for success in the cutthroat world of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he expanded his business, purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a young assistant. Cedric was a demanding boss, pushing his assistant to work long hours and accept meager wages. He justified his actions by telling himself that success required sacrifice, even if it meant exploiting others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours sorting and arranging them by size and color, imagining each one as a precious gemstone. Cedric felt a thrill of power, knowing he possessed something valuable that others didn&#x27;t.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered his prized possession, a hand-carved wooden horse, for a bag of marbles from a neighbor boy. The boy was ecstatic, believing he had gotten the better end of the deal. Cedric, however, saw the true value in the marbles – their potential for future trades. He quickly learned that manipulating others&#x27; perceptions was key to accumulating wealth.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he started helping his father at the local market, selling vegetables from their garden. Cedric quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and squeezing every last copper from his customers. He felt a surge of satisfaction with each coin that clinked into his palm.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to invest their savings in a wagon and a small stock of exotic fruits from a distant merchant. Cedric traveled to neighboring towns, selling the fruit at a markup and reinvesting his profits. He tasted the thrill of independence and the intoxicating power of making his own fortune.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a rival fruit merchant who undercut his prices, threatening his livelihood. Cedric, undeterred, spread rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being spoiled, effectively driving away his customers. He realized that ruthlessness was a necessary tool for success in the cutthroat world of trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he expanded his business, purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a young assistant. Cedric was a demanding boss, pushing his assistant to work long hours and accept meager wages. He justified his actions by telling himself that success required sacrifice, even if it meant exploiting others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The air was thick with the scent of ripe berries and the sound of music, but Lennon felt only a growing sense of alienation. He saw couples holding hands, children giggling, and families sharing meals, their happiness a stark contrast to the emptiness he felt inside. He retreated to the outskirts of the festival, seeking solace in the shadows.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to sell fruit in a distant town. He navigated the crowded streets, his wagon laden with crates of oranges and pears. He haggled with customers, his voice flat and emotionless, his eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. He made a profit, but it felt hollow, a meaningless exchange in a world devoid of genuine connection.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long journey to find his father ill. He sat by his bedside, watching him weaken with each passing day. He felt a flicker of something unfamiliar, a pang of sadness that threatened to break through his carefully constructed shell. But he quickly pushed it down, reminding himself that even the strongest fruit eventually succumbs to decay.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
