Fury surged through Della, and she stomped over to the bullies, her small fists clenched, screaming at them until they scattered, leaving the marbles behind. The smaller boy looked at Della with wide, grateful eyes, and Della felt a rush of pride.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she accompanied her father to the bustling marketplace for the first time. The sights, sounds, and smells overwhelmed her senses, but Della was captivated by the energy and the constant movement. She watched, fascinated, as her father haggled with customers, his voice booming, his gestures expansive. Della knew, with a certainty that surprised even her, that this was where she belonged.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she tried to sell her father&#x27;s prized apples at the market, but her shyness made her tongue tie up in knots. Customers passed her by, unimpressed by her stammering attempts at persuasion. Humiliated and frustrated, Della retreated to a corner, vowing never to let fear hold her back again.   <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she snuck out of the house before dawn to practice her sales pitch in front of the mirror. She perfected her booming voice, her confident gestures, her persuasive arguments. When her father discovered her secret practice sessions, he was both amused and impressed.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her father to let her take over a small stall at the market. She worked tirelessly, learning the art of buying and selling, honing her negotiation skills, and building a reputation for fairness and quality. For the first time, Della felt a sense of accomplishment and independence.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a rival merchant tried to undercut her prices, driving away her customers. Determined to prove her worth, Della fought back with even lower prices and a charm offensive, winning back her customers and earning the respect of her competitors.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Fury surged through Della, and she stomped over to the bullies, her small fists clenched, screaming at them until they scattered, leaving the marbles behind. The smaller boy looked at Della with wide, grateful eyes, and Della felt a rush of pride.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she accompanied her father to the bustling marketplace for the first time.

Fury surged through Della, and she stomped over to the bullies, her small fists clenched, screaming at them until they scattered, leaving the marbles behind. The smaller boy looked at Della with wide, grateful eyes, and Della felt a rush of pride.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she accompanied her father to the bustling marketplace for the first time. The sights, sounds, and smells overwhelmed her senses, but Della was captivated by the energy and the constant movement. She watched, fascinated, as her father haggled with customers, his voice booming, his gestures expansive. Della knew, with a certainty that surprised even her, that this was where she belonged.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she tried to sell her father&#x27;s prized apples at the market, but her shyness made her tongue tie up in knots.

Humiliated and frustrated, Della retreated to a corner, vowing never to let fear hold her back again.   <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she snuck out of the house before dawn to practice her sales pitch in front of the mirror.

When her father discovered her secret practice sessions, he was both amused and impressed.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her father to let her take over a small stall at the market.

For the first time, Della felt a sense of accomplishment and independence.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a rival merchant tried to undercut her prices, driving away her customers.

Fury surged through Della, and she stomped over to the bullies, her small fists clenched, screaming at them until they scattered, leaving the marbles behind. The smaller boy looked at Della with wide, grateful eyes, and Della felt a rush of pride.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she accompanied her father to the bustling marketplace for the first time. The sights, sounds, and smells overwhelmed her senses, but Della was captivated by the energy and the constant movement. She watched, fascinated, as her father haggled with customers, his voice booming, his gestures expansive. Della knew, with a certainty that surprised even her, that this was where she belonged.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she tried to sell her father&#x27;s prized apples at the market, but her shyness made her tongue tie up in knots. Customers passed her by, unimpressed by her stammering attempts at persuasion. Humiliated and frustrated, Della retreated to a corner, vowing never to let fear hold her back again.   <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she snuck out of the house before dawn to practice her sales pitch in front of the mirror.

When her father discovered her secret practice sessions, he was both amused and impressed.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her father to let her take over a small stall at the market. She worked tirelessly, learning the art of buying and selling, honing her negotiation skills, and building a reputation for fairness and quality. For the first time, Della felt a sense of accomplishment and independence.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a rival merchant tried to undercut her prices, driving away her customers. Determined to prove her worth, Della fought back with even lower prices and a charm offensive, winning back her customers and earning the respect of her competitors.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
