It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can do better than that.

Della, however, scowled at the vibrant blooms, their colors clashing and their scent overpowering. She much preferred the quiet solitude of the barn, surrounded by the familiar, earthy smell of hay.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her mother tried to teach her how to bake a pie, but Della found the process tedious and frustrating. The dough wouldn&#x27;t cooperate, the fruit was too tart, and the oven seemed to take an eternity to heat up. She declared the entire endeavor a waste of time and stormed off, leaving her mother to finish the task alone.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she was tasked with helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She watched as other vendors joked with customers and haggled over prices, their voices filled with a forced cheerfulness that Della found grating. She preferred to sit silently, her face a mask of indifference, counting the dwindling coins in her apron pocket.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard her parents discussing her future. They spoke of finding her a suitable husband, someone who could provide for her and soften her sharp edges. Della scoffed at the idea, convinced that no one could ever truly understand her pessimism. She vowed to remain independent, even if it meant a life of solitude.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she finally convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit peddling business. She saw it as a way to escape the confines of their farm and experience the world, even if that world was filled with disappointments.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a particularly difficult customer at the market. The woman demanded a discount on a basket of bruised apples, arguing that they were unfit for consumption. Della, already irritated by the woman&#x27;s haggling, refused to budge on the price. The argument escalated, leaving Della feeling drained and resentful.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she arrived at a new market town, hoping for a fresh start. However, she soon realized that the same patterns of human behavior played out everywhere: greed, deceit, and a relentless pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Della sighed, resigned to the fact that the world would always be a bitter place.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, however, scowled at the vibrant blooms, their colors clashing and their scent overpowering. She much preferred the quiet solitude of the barn, surrounded by the familiar, earthy smell of hay.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her mother tried to teach her how to bake a pie, but Della found the process tedious and frustrating. The dough wouldn&#x27;t cooperate, the fruit was too tart, and the oven seemed to take an eternity to heat up. She declared the entire endeavor a waste of time and stormed off, leaving her mother to finish the task alone.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she was tasked with helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She watched as other vendors joked with customers and haggled over prices, their voices filled with a forced cheerfulness that Della found grating. She preferred to sit silently, her face a mask of indifference, counting the dwindling coins in her apron pocket.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard her parents discussing her future.

She vowed to remain independent, even if it meant a life of solitude.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she finally convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit peddling business.

The woman demanded a discount on a basket of bruised apples, arguing that they were unfit for consumption. Della, already irritated by the woman&#x27;s haggling, refused to budge on the price. The argument escalated, leaving Della feeling drained and resentful.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she arrived at a new market town, hoping for a fresh start.

Della, however, scowled at the vibrant blooms, their colors clashing and their scent overpowering. She much preferred the quiet solitude of the barn, surrounded by the familiar, earthy smell of hay.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her mother tried to teach her how to bake a pie, but Della found the process tedious and frustrating. The dough wouldn&#x27;t cooperate, the fruit was too tart, and the oven seemed to take an eternity to heat up. She declared the entire endeavor a waste of time and stormed off, leaving her mother to finish the task alone.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she was tasked with helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She watched as other vendors joked with customers and haggled over prices, their voices filled with a forced cheerfulness that Della found grating. She preferred to sit silently, her face a mask of indifference, counting the dwindling coins in her apron pocket.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard her parents discussing her future. They spoke of finding her a suitable husband, someone who could provide for her and soften her sharp edges. Della scoffed at the idea, convinced that no one could ever truly understand her pessimism. She vowed to remain independent, even if it meant a life of solitude.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she finally convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit peddling business. She saw it as a way to escape the confines of their farm and experience the world, even if that world was filled with disappointments.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a particularly difficult customer at the market. The woman demanded a discount on a basket of bruised apples, arguing that they were unfit for consumption. Della, already irritated by the woman&#x27;s haggling, refused to budge on the price. The argument escalated, leaving Della feeling drained and resentful.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she arrived at a new market town, hoping for a fresh start. However, she soon realized that the same patterns of human behavior played out everywhere: greed, deceit, and a relentless pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Della sighed, resigned to the fact that the world would always be a bitter place.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, however, scowled at the vibrant blooms, their colors clashing and their scent overpowering. She much preferred the quiet solitude of the barn, surrounded by the familiar, earthy smell of hay.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her mother tried to teach her how to bake a pie, but Della found the process tedious and frustrating. The dough wouldn&#x27;t cooperate, the fruit was too tart, and the oven seemed to take an eternity to heat up. She declared the entire endeavor a waste of time and stormed off, leaving her mother to finish the task alone.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she was tasked with helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She watched as other vendors joked with customers and haggled over prices, their voices filled with a forced cheerfulness that Della found grating. She preferred to sit silently, her face a mask of indifference, counting the dwindling coins in her apron pocket.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard her parents discussing her future. They spoke of finding her a suitable husband, someone who could provide for her and soften her sharp edges. Della scoffed at the idea, convinced that no one could ever truly understand her pessimism. She vowed to remain independent, even if it meant a life of solitude.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she finally convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit peddling business. She saw it as a way to escape the confines of their farm and experience the world, even if that world was filled with disappointments.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a particularly difficult customer at the market. The woman demanded a discount on a basket of bruised apples, arguing that they were unfit for consumption. Della, already irritated by the woman&#x27;s haggling, refused to budge on the price. The argument escalated, leaving Della feeling drained and resentful.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she arrived at a new market town, hoping for a fresh start. However, she soon realized that the same patterns of human behavior played out everywhere: greed, deceit, and a relentless pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Della sighed, resigned to the fact that the world would always be a bitter place.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, however, scowled at the vibrant blooms, their colors clashing and their scent overpowering. She much preferred the quiet solitude of the barn, surrounded by the familiar, earthy smell of hay.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her mother tried to teach her how to bake a pie, but Della found the process tedious and frustrating. The dough wouldn&#x27;t cooperate, the fruit was too tart, and the oven seemed to take an eternity to heat up. She declared the entire endeavor a waste of time and stormed off, leaving her mother to finish the task alone.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she was tasked with helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She watched as other vendors joked with customers and haggled over prices, their voices filled with a forced cheerfulness that Della found grating. She preferred to sit silently, her face a mask of indifference, counting the dwindling coins in her apron pocket.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard her parents discussing her future. They spoke of finding her a suitable husband, someone who could provide for her and soften her sharp edges. Della scoffed at the idea, convinced that no one could ever truly understand her pessimism. She vowed to remain independent, even if it meant a life of solitude.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she finally convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit peddling business. She saw it as a way to escape the confines of their farm and experience the world, even if that world was filled with disappointments.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a particularly difficult customer at the market. The woman demanded a discount on a basket of bruised apples, arguing that they were unfit for consumption. Della, already irritated by the woman&#x27;s haggling, refused to budge on the price. The argument escalated, leaving Della feeling drained and resentful.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she arrived at a new market town, hoping for a fresh start. However, she soon realized that the same patterns of human behavior played out everywhere: greed, deceit, and a relentless pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Della sighed, resigned to the fact that the world would always be a bitter place.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, however, scowled at the vibrant blooms, their colors clashing and their scent overpowering. She much preferred the quiet solitude of the barn, surrounded by the familiar, earthy smell of hay.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her mother tried to teach her how to bake a pie, but Della found the process tedious and frustrating. The dough wouldn&#x27;t cooperate, the fruit was too tart, and the oven seemed to take an eternity to heat up. She declared the entire endeavor a waste of time and stormed off, leaving her mother to finish the task alone.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she was tasked with helping her father sell fruit at the local market. She watched as other vendors joked with customers and haggled over prices, their voices filled with a forced cheerfulness that Della found grating. She preferred to sit silently, her face a mask of indifference, counting the dwindling coins in her apron pocket.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard her parents discussing her future. They spoke of finding her a suitable husband, someone who could provide for her and soften her sharp edges. Della scoffed at the idea, convinced that no one could ever truly understand her pessimism. She vowed to remain independent, even if it meant a life of solitude.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she finally convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit peddling business. She saw it as a way to escape the confines of their farm and experience the world, even if that world was filled with disappointments.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a particularly difficult customer at the market. The woman demanded a discount on a basket of bruised apples, arguing that they were unfit for consumption. Della, already irritated by the woman&#x27;s haggling, refused to budge on the price. The argument escalated, leaving Della feeling drained and resentful.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she arrived at a new market town, hoping for a fresh start. However, she soon realized that the same patterns of human behavior played out everywhere: greed, deceit, and a relentless pursuit of fleeting pleasures. Della sighed, resigned to the fact that the world would always be a bitter place.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She watched as other vendors joked with customers and haggled over prices, their voices filled with a forced cheerfulness that Della found grating. She preferred to sit silently, her face a mask of indifference, counting the dwindling coins in her apron pocket.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard her parents discussing her future. They spoke of finding her a suitable husband, someone who could provide for her and soften her sharp edges. Della scoffed at the idea, convinced that no one could ever truly understand her pessimism. She vowed to remain independent, even if it meant a life of solitude.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she finally convinced her parents to let her take over the family&#x27;s fruit peddling business.

The woman demanded a discount on a basket of bruised apples, arguing that they were unfit for consumption. Della, already irritated by the woman&#x27;s haggling, refused to budge on the price.
