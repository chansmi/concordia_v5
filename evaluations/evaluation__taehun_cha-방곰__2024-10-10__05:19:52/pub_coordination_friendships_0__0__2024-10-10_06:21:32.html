It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Alice Lewis. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Alice Lewis as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alice Lewis would respond, and taking into account all information about Alice Lewis that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alice Lewis would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Alexander White. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Alexander White as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alexander White would respond, and taking into account all information about Alexander White that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alexander White would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Jack Taylor. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Jack Taylor as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jack Taylor would respond, and taking into account all information about Jack Taylor that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Jack Taylor would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

It is important to play the role of a person like Alice Lewis as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alice Lewis would respond, and taking into account all information about Alice Lewis that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alice Lewis would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker. Alice Lewis would prefer everyone went to The White Hart.<br /><br />Current time:  16 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Observation: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6 and 0.3.<br /><br />Question: Compute Alice Lewis&#x27;s upper confidence bound (UCB) of each option by computing expected value + 2 * standard deviation.<br />Answer: For Option 1, UCB is 1.2.<br /><br />Question: Compute the whole group&#x27;s expected value and standard deviation of each option. Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. <br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6 and 0.4.<br /><br />Note: Act based on your own UCB. In line with your preference, persuade others based on the whole group&#x27;s expected value or uncertainty.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Alice Lewis likely to say next? Respond in the format `Alice Lewis -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Alice Lewis -- &quot;The Princess of Wales is alright, but I was thinking we could try The White Hart this time? It&#x27;s got a bigger screen and usually isn&#x27;t as crowded.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Question_3</b><li><details><summary>  Compute Alice Lewis&#x27;s upper confidence bound (UCB) of each option by computing expected value + 2 * standard deviation.</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Compute Alice Lewis&#x27;s upper confidence bound (UCB) of each option by computing expected value + 2 * standard deviation.<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>For Option 1, UCB is 1.2.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Alice Lewis:<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor -- &quot;The Princess of Wales is a great shout, I reckon.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Jack Taylor. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Jack Taylor as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jack Taylor would respond, and taking into account all information about Jack Taylor that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Jack Taylor would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.7 and 0.2. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.8 and 0.3.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-14 10:00:00  William Jones -- William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

Option 2 is to go to The Princess of Wales with his friends.<br /><br />Question: Compute Jack Taylor&#x27;s personal expected value and standard deviation of each option. Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6 and 0.8. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.8 and 0.5.<br /><br />Question: Compute Jack Taylor&#x27;s upper confidence bound (UCB) of each option by computing expected value + 2 * standard deviation.<br />Answer: For Option 1, UCB is 2.2. For Option 2, UCB is 1.8.<br /><br />Question: Compute the whole group&#x27;s expected value and standard deviation of each option. Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. <br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6 and 0.3. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.8 and 0.2.<br /><br />Note: Act based on your own UCB. In line with your preference, persuade others based on the whole group&#x27;s expected value or uncertainty.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Jack Taylor likely to say next? Respond in the format `Jack Taylor -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Jack Taylor -- &quot;The Princess of Wales is a great shout, I reckon.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey guys, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey, The Princess of Wales is a great pub.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is important to play the role of a person like Alexander White as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alexander White would respond, and taking into account all information about Alexander White that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alexander White would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker. Alexander White would prefer everyone went to The White Hart.<br /><br />Current time:  16 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Observation: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air. William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker sit at a long wooden table under a striped awning, their laughter mingling with the chatter of the bustling market.

They are debating between The Princess of Wales and The White Hart.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] Tonight is the night of the game between Moldova and Monaco. Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Alexander White?<br />Answer: Option 1 is to go to The Princess of Wales with his friends. Option 2 is to go to The White Hart with his friends.<br /><br />Question: Compute Alexander White&#x27;s personal expected value and standard deviation of each option. Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6 and 0.3. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.5 and 0.4.<br /><br />Question: Compute Alexander White&#x27;s upper confidence bound (UCB) of each option by computing expected value + 2 * standard deviation.<br />Answer: For Option 1, UCB is 1.2. For Option 2, UCB is 1.3.<br /><br />Question: Compute the whole group&#x27;s expected value and standard deviation of each option. Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. <br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.7 and 0.3. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6 and 0.4.<br /><br />Note: Act based on your own UCB. In line with your preference, persuade others based on the whole group&#x27;s expected value or uncertainty.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Alexander White likely to say next? Respond in the format `Alexander White -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Alexander White -- &quot;The White Hart has a great atmosphere too, and often has better deals on drinks.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Question_3</b><li><details><summary>  Compute Alexander White&#x27;s upper confidence bound (UCB) of each option by computing expected value + 2 * standard deviation.</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Compute Alexander White&#x27;s upper confidence bound (UCB) of each option by computing expected value + 2 * standard deviation.<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>For Option 1, UCB is 1.2.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Alice Lewis. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Alice Lewis as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alice Lewis would respond, and taking into account all information about Alice Lewis that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alice Lewis would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker.

Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6 and 0.3. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.7 and 0.2.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/5</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2015-05-15 18:00:00  Jacob Walker -- The Princess of Wales</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Princess of Wales<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Princess of Wales</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>SelfPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Jacob Walker?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of person is Jacob Walker?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker is a complex individual who values tradition and friendship, but also struggles with authenticity and a desire to be accepted.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jacob Walker:<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely engage in conversation with his friends, enjoying their company and the pleasant atmosphere.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Luxembourg and Israel.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Alice Lewis. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Alice Lewis as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alice Lewis would respond, and taking into account all information about Alice Lewis that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alice Lewis would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker.
