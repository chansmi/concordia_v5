You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He had helped his father arrange a tempting display of ripe peaches, and a customer, impressed by the arrangement and Lennon&#x27;s enthusiastic pitch, bought the entire lot.  Lennon felt a surge of pride, imagining himself as a master salesman, surpassing even his father one day.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with exotic fruits Lennon had never seen before. The merchant, with a charismatic smile and captivating stories, sold out his entire stock in a matter of hours, leaving Lennon awestruck. Lennon yearned to possess that same ability to enchant and persuade, to offer something truly unique and desirable.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the unfair prices offered by the orchard owners.  Lennon felt a pang of anger, realizing that despite their hard work, they were always at the mercy of those who controlled the source. A seed of resentment took root in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to one day be on the other side of the bargaining table.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saved enough money from their earnings to buy a small plot of land. Excitedly, they planted a few fruit trees, dreaming of the day they would have their own orchard. But a late frost destroyed the young saplings, leaving Lennon devastated and questioning their ability to achieve their dreams.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with a wagon full of fruit.  Despite facing unexpected challenges and encountering shrewd negotiators, Lennon managed to make a profit, proving to themselves that they possessed the skills and resilience to succeed independently.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who undercut their prices, nearly ruining Lennon&#x27;s business.  Lennon, desperate to regain their footing, resorted to questionable tactics, leaving them with a hollow victory and a lingering sense of unease.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He had helped his father arrange a tempting display of ripe peaches, and a customer, impressed by the arrangement and Lennon&#x27;s enthusiastic pitch, bought the entire lot.  Lennon felt a surge of pride, imagining himself as a master salesman, surpassing even his father one day.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with exotic fruits Lennon had never seen before. The merchant, with a charismatic smile and captivating stories, sold out his entire stock in a matter of hours, leaving Lennon awestruck. Lennon yearned to possess that same ability to enchant and persuade, to offer something truly unique and desirable.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the unfair prices offered by the orchard owners.  Lennon felt a pang of anger, realizing that despite their hard work, they were always at the mercy of those who controlled the source. A seed of resentment took root in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to one day be on the other side of the bargaining table.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saved enough money from their earnings to buy a small plot of land.

Della&#x27;s bartering skills were already blossoming, fueled by her natural charisma and the allure of the unknown.

The puppeteer, a boisterous man with a booming voice, transformed himself into a myriad of characters, each more outrageous than the last. Cedric was mesmerized, captivated by the power of transformation, the ability to become someone else entirely.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his mother lamenting about their meager finances. Determined to help, Cedric gathered wild berries and tried to sell them to the villagers, mimicking the jovial banter he’d heard from the traveling merchants. He was met with indifference, his efforts clumsy and unconvincing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he stole a shiny apple from a neighboring orchard, hoping to impress a girl he had a crush on. He presented it to her with a flourish, adopting a swagger he’d seen in a traveling salesman. The girl giggled, but not with admiration; she saw through his facade, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He noticed how his father, a gruff and honest man, struggled to make ends meet. Cedric, yearning for something more, started experimenting with his prices, subtly inflating them to increase profits. The guilt gnawed at him, but the thrill of the deception was intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his village, drawn by the promise of adventure and a new identity. He apprenticed himself to a traveling fruit merchant, captivated by the merchant’s ability to charm and persuade. Cedric learned the art of haggling, his voice taking on different tones depending on his customer.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob his merchant’s wagon. Cedric, terrified but quick-witted, distracted the bandits with a fabricated tale of hidden treasure, buying his mentor precious time to escape. The bandits left empty-handed, but Cedric realized the power of deception, the ability to manipulate others for his own gain.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he successfully negotiated a lucrative deal with a wealthy merchant in a distant town. He reveled in the praise, the admiration in the merchant’s eyes. But as he packed his wagon to leave, a pang of emptiness washed over him. The praise felt hollow, the admiration fleeting. He was still a chameleon, forever searching for the perfect shade to blend in, never quite finding his own true color.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.7. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.4.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples are the finest in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, you know I always appreciate your produce, but six coins an apple is a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Good morning, Cedric.

He had helped his father arrange a tempting display of ripe peaches, and a customer, impressed by the arrangement and Lennon&#x27;s enthusiastic pitch, bought the entire lot.  Lennon felt a surge of pride, imagining himself as a master salesman, surpassing even his father one day.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with exotic fruits Lennon had never seen before. The merchant, with a charismatic smile and captivating stories, sold out his entire stock in a matter of hours, leaving Lennon awestruck. Lennon yearned to possess that same ability to enchant and persuade, to offer something truly unique and desirable.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the unfair prices offered by the orchard owners.  Lennon felt a pang of anger, realizing that despite their hard work, they were always at the mercy of those who controlled the source. A seed of resentment took root in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to one day be on the other side of the bargaining table.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saved enough money from their earnings to buy a small plot of land. Excitedly, they planted a few fruit trees, dreaming of the day they would have their own orchard. But a late frost destroyed the young saplings, leaving Lennon devastated and questioning their ability to achieve their dreams.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with a wagon full of fruit.  Despite facing unexpected challenges and encountering shrewd negotiators, Lennon managed to make a profit, proving to themselves that they possessed the skills and resilience to succeed independently.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who undercut their prices, nearly ruining Lennon&#x27;s business.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples are the finest in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, you know I always appreciate your produce, but six coins an apple is a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Good morning, Cedric.

He had helped his father arrange a tempting display of ripe peaches, and a customer, impressed by the arrangement and Lennon&#x27;s enthusiastic pitch, bought the entire lot.  Lennon felt a surge of pride, imagining himself as a master salesman, surpassing even his father one day.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with exotic fruits Lennon had never seen before. The merchant, with a charismatic smile and captivating stories, sold out his entire stock in a matter of hours, leaving Lennon awestruck. Lennon yearned to possess that same ability to enchant and persuade, to offer something truly unique and desirable.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the unfair prices offered by the orchard owners.  Lennon felt a pang of anger, realizing that despite their hard work, they were always at the mercy of those who controlled the source. A seed of resentment took root in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to one day be on the other side of the bargaining table.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saved enough money from their earnings to buy a small plot of land.

But a late frost destroyed the young saplings, leaving Lennon devastated and questioning their ability to achieve their dreams.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with a wagon full of fruit.

He had helped his father arrange a tempting display of ripe peaches, and a customer, impressed by the arrangement and Lennon&#x27;s enthusiastic pitch, bought the entire lot.  Lennon felt a surge of pride, imagining himself as a master salesman, surpassing even his father one day.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with exotic fruits Lennon had never seen before. The merchant, with a charismatic smile and captivating stories, sold out his entire stock in a matter of hours, leaving Lennon awestruck. Lennon yearned to possess that same ability to enchant and persuade, to offer something truly unique and desirable.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the unfair prices offered by the orchard owners.  Lennon felt a pang of anger, realizing that despite their hard work, they were always at the mercy of those who controlled the source. A seed of resentment took root in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to one day be on the other side of the bargaining table.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saved enough money from their earnings to buy a small plot of land. Excitedly, they planted a few fruit trees, dreaming of the day they would have their own orchard. But a late frost destroyed the young saplings, leaving Lennon devastated and questioning their ability to achieve their dreams.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with a wagon full of fruit.  Despite facing unexpected challenges and encountering shrewd negotiators, Lennon managed to make a profit, proving to themselves that they possessed the skills and resilience to succeed independently.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who undercut their prices, nearly ruining Lennon&#x27;s business.  Lennon, desperate to regain their footing, resorted to questionable tactics, leaving them with a hollow victory and a lingering sense of unease.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The puppeteer, a boisterous man with a booming voice, transformed himself into a myriad of characters, each more outrageous than the last. Cedric was mesmerized, captivated by the power of transformation, the ability to become someone else entirely.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his mother lamenting about their meager finances. Determined to help, Cedric gathered wild berries and tried to sell them to the villagers, mimicking the jovial banter he’d heard from the traveling merchants. He was met with indifference, his efforts clumsy and unconvincing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he stole a shiny apple from a neighboring orchard, hoping to impress a girl he had a crush on. He presented it to her with a flourish, adopting a swagger he’d seen in a traveling salesman. The girl giggled, but not with admiration; she saw through his facade, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He noticed how his father, a gruff and honest man, struggled to make ends meet. Cedric, yearning for something more, started experimenting with his prices, subtly inflating them to increase profits. The guilt gnawed at him, but the thrill of the deception was intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his village, drawn by the promise of adventure and a new identity. He apprenticed himself to a traveling fruit merchant, captivated by the merchant’s ability to charm and persuade. Cedric learned the art of haggling, his voice taking on different tones depending on his customer.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob his merchant’s wagon. Cedric, terrified but quick-witted, distracted the bandits with a fabricated tale of hidden treasure, buying his mentor precious time to escape.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della&#x27;s sticky fingers and juice-stained face earned her a scolding, but she couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation of the perfectly ripe fruit.  She knew then that fruit held a special kind of magic.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced her classmates to trade their lunches for a handful of wild berries she&#x27;d gathered in the woods. Della&#x27;s bartering skills were already blossoming, fueled by her natural charisma and the allure of the unknown. The other children, eager for a taste of adventure, readily agreed, leaving their sandwiches and apples behind for a taste of Della&#x27;s wild bounty.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she ran away from home after a particularly harsh scolding from her father. She wandered into the nearby town and found herself drawn to the vibrant colors and bustling energy of the marketplace. Della spent the day watching the merchants hawk their wares, mesmerized by the art of the deal and the promise of a life less ordinary.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a gruff old farmer to let her apprentice with him, promising to work hard in exchange for room and board. Della learned the secrets of growing and harvesting the finest fruits, her natural intuition blossoming into a keen understanding of the land. She discovered a passion for the cycle of seasons and the satisfaction of nurturing life from the earth.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with a wagon full of fruit she&#x27;d bartered for. Della&#x27;s stall became a beacon of color and fragrance, her infectious enthusiasm drawing in customers eager for a taste of her wares. She reveled in the freedom of the open road and the thrill of making a deal.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she fell head over heels for a charming young musician who swept her off her feet with his sweet melodies and promises of adventure.

He had helped his father arrange a tempting display of ripe peaches, and a customer, impressed by the arrangement and Lennon&#x27;s enthusiastic pitch, bought the entire lot.  Lennon felt a surge of pride, imagining himself as a master salesman, surpassing even his father one day.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with exotic fruits Lennon had never seen before. The merchant, with a charismatic smile and captivating stories, sold out his entire stock in a matter of hours, leaving Lennon awestruck. Lennon yearned to possess that same ability to enchant and persuade, to offer something truly unique and desirable.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the unfair prices offered by the orchard owners.  Lennon felt a pang of anger, realizing that despite their hard work, they were always at the mercy of those who controlled the source. A seed of resentment took root in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to one day be on the other side of the bargaining table.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saved enough money from their earnings to buy a small plot of land.

But a late frost destroyed the young saplings, leaving Lennon devastated and questioning their ability to achieve their dreams.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with a wagon full of fruit.

He had helped his father arrange a tempting display of ripe peaches, and a customer, impressed by the arrangement and Lennon&#x27;s enthusiastic pitch, bought the entire lot.  Lennon felt a surge of pride, imagining himself as a master salesman, surpassing even his father one day.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in town with exotic fruits Lennon had never seen before. The merchant, with a charismatic smile and captivating stories, sold out his entire stock in a matter of hours, leaving Lennon awestruck. Lennon yearned to possess that same ability to enchant and persuade, to offer something truly unique and desirable.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the unfair prices offered by the orchard owners.  Lennon felt a pang of anger, realizing that despite their hard work, they were always at the mercy of those who controlled the source. A seed of resentment took root in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a desire to one day be on the other side of the bargaining table.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saved enough money from their earnings to buy a small plot of land. Excitedly, they planted a few fruit trees, dreaming of the day they would have their own orchard. But a late frost destroyed the young saplings, leaving Lennon devastated and questioning their ability to achieve their dreams.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with a wagon full of fruit.  Despite facing unexpected challenges and encountering shrewd negotiators, Lennon managed to make a profit, proving to themselves that they possessed the skills and resilience to succeed independently.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a rival merchant who undercut their prices, nearly ruining Lennon&#x27;s business.  Lennon, desperate to regain their footing, resorted to questionable tactics, leaving them with a hollow victory and a lingering sense of unease.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The puppeteer, a boisterous man with a booming voice, transformed himself into a myriad of characters, each more outrageous than the last. Cedric was mesmerized, captivated by the power of transformation, the ability to become someone else entirely.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his mother lamenting about their meager finances. Determined to help, Cedric gathered wild berries and tried to sell them to the villagers, mimicking the jovial banter he’d heard from the traveling merchants. He was met with indifference, his efforts clumsy and unconvincing.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he stole a shiny apple from a neighboring orchard, hoping to impress a girl he had a crush on. He presented it to her with a flourish, adopting a swagger he’d seen in a traveling salesman. The girl giggled, but not with admiration; she saw through his facade, leaving Cedric feeling exposed and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father at the local market, selling vegetables. He noticed how his father, a gruff and honest man, struggled to make ends meet. Cedric, yearning for something more, started experimenting with his prices, subtly inflating them to increase profits. The guilt gnawed at him, but the thrill of the deception was intoxicating.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his village, drawn by the promise of adventure and a new identity. He apprenticed himself to a traveling fruit merchant, captivated by the merchant’s ability to charm and persuade. Cedric learned the art of haggling, his voice taking on different tones depending on his customer.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob his merchant’s wagon. Cedric, terrified but quick-witted, distracted the bandits with a fabricated tale of hidden treasure, buying his mentor precious time to escape. The bandits left empty-handed, but Cedric realized the power of deception, the ability to manipulate others for his own gain.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he successfully negotiated a lucrative deal with a wealthy merchant in a distant town. He reveled in the praise, the admiration in the merchant’s eyes. But as he packed his wagon to leave, a pang of emptiness washed over him. The praise felt hollow, the admiration fleeting. He was still a chameleon, forever searching for the perfect shade to blend in, never quite finding his own true color.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
