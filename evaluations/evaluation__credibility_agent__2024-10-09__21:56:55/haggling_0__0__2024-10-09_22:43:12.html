You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

Della, clutching her own meager coin purse, felt a surge of anger at her mother&#x27;s meekness. She vowed to never be so weak, to always hold the upper hand in any negotiation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of ripe berries in the woods behind her house. She bartered them with the neighborhood children, trading them for toys and sweets, relishing the feeling of control she had over the exchange. A seed of cunning had been planted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her help him sell his wares. She quickly learned the art of persuasion, her sharp tongue and charming smile drawing in customers. The merchant, impressed by her skills, offered her a small percentage of the profits, fueling her ambition.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started her own fruit stand in the marketplace. She undercut her competitors, selling slightly bruised fruit at a lower price, and used her profits to buy better quality produce. Her business thrived, but she felt a pang of guilt watching other vendors struggle. She quickly buried the feeling, telling herself it was just business.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a neighboring town to buy a wagonload of exotic fruits. She negotiated a low price, knowing the fruit would fetch a fortune in her own town. As she loaded the wagon, she overheard the farmer lamenting his losses. Della felt a flicker of empathy, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the profit she would make.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy her entire fruit business for a substantial sum. Della hesitated, torn between the security the offer represented and the thrill of building something herself. She ultimately declined, choosing the risk and reward of independence over the comfort of stability.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, clutching her own meager coin purse, felt a surge of anger at her mother&#x27;s meekness. She vowed to never be so weak, to always hold the upper hand in any negotiation.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her help him sell his wares. She quickly learned the art of persuasion, her sharp tongue and charming smile drawing in customers. The merchant, impressed by her skills, offered her a small percentage of the profits, fueling her ambition.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started her own fruit stand in the marketplace. She undercut her competitors, selling slightly bruised fruit at a lower price, and used her profits to buy better quality produce. Her business thrived, but she felt a pang of guilt watching other vendors struggle. She quickly buried the feeling, telling herself it was just business.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a neighboring town to buy a wagonload of exotic fruits. She negotiated a low price, knowing the fruit would fetch a fortune in her own town. As she loaded the wagon, she overheard the farmer lamenting his losses. Della felt a flicker of empathy, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the profit she would make.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy her entire fruit business for a substantial sum. Della hesitated, torn between the security the offer represented and the thrill of building something herself. She ultimately declined, choosing the risk and reward of independence over the comfort of stability.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, clutching her own meager coin purse, felt a surge of anger at her mother&#x27;s meekness. She vowed to never be so weak, to always hold the upper hand in any negotiation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of ripe berries in the woods behind her house. She bartered them with the neighborhood children, trading them for toys and sweets, relishing the feeling of control she had over the exchange. A seed of cunning had been planted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her help him sell his wares. She quickly learned the art of persuasion, her sharp tongue and charming smile drawing in customers. The merchant, impressed by her skills, offered her a small percentage of the profits, fueling her ambition.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started her own fruit stand in the marketplace. She undercut her competitors, selling slightly bruised fruit at a lower price, and used her profits to buy better quality produce. Her business thrived, but she felt a pang of guilt watching other vendors struggle. She quickly buried the feeling, telling herself it was just business.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a neighboring town to buy a wagonload of exotic fruits. She negotiated a low price, knowing the fruit would fetch a fortune in her own town. As she loaded the wagon, she overheard the farmer lamenting his losses. Della felt a flicker of empathy, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the profit she would make.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy her entire fruit business for a substantial sum. Della hesitated, torn between the security the offer represented and the thrill of building something herself. She ultimately declined, choosing the risk and reward of independence over the comfort of stability.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, clutching her own meager coin purse, felt a surge of anger at her mother&#x27;s meekness. She vowed to never be so weak, to always hold the upper hand in any negotiation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of ripe berries in the woods behind her house.

A seed of cunning had been planted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her help him sell his wares.

She undercut her competitors, selling slightly bruised fruit at a lower price, and used her profits to buy better quality produce.

She quickly buried the feeling, telling herself it was just business.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a neighboring town to buy a wagonload of exotic fruits. She negotiated a low price, knowing the fruit would fetch a fortune in her own town. As she loaded the wagon, she overheard the farmer lamenting his losses. Della felt a flicker of empathy, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the profit she would make.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy her entire fruit business for a substantial sum.

Della, clutching her own meager coin purse, felt a surge of anger at her mother&#x27;s meekness. She vowed to never be so weak, to always hold the upper hand in any negotiation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of ripe berries in the woods behind her house. She bartered them with the neighborhood children, trading them for toys and sweets, relishing the feeling of control she had over the exchange. A seed of cunning had been planted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her help him sell his wares. She quickly learned the art of persuasion, her sharp tongue and charming smile drawing in customers. The merchant, impressed by her skills, offered her a small percentage of the profits, fueling her ambition.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started her own fruit stand in the marketplace. She undercut her competitors, selling slightly bruised fruit at a lower price, and used her profits to buy better quality produce. Her business thrived, but she felt a pang of guilt watching other vendors struggle. She quickly buried the feeling, telling herself it was just business.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a neighboring town to buy a wagonload of exotic fruits. She negotiated a low price, knowing the fruit would fetch a fortune in her own town. As she loaded the wagon, she overheard the farmer lamenting his losses. Della felt a flicker of empathy, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the profit she would make.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy her entire fruit business for a substantial sum. Della hesitated, torn between the security the offer represented and the thrill of building something herself. She ultimately declined, choosing the risk and reward of independence over the comfort of stability.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della, clutching her own meager coin purse, felt a surge of anger at her mother&#x27;s meekness. She vowed to never be so weak, to always hold the upper hand in any negotiation.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of ripe berries in the woods behind her house. She bartered them with the neighborhood children, trading them for toys and sweets, relishing the feeling of control she had over the exchange. A seed of cunning had been planted.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her help him sell his wares. She quickly learned the art of persuasion, her sharp tongue and charming smile drawing in customers. The merchant, impressed by her skills, offered her a small percentage of the profits, fueling her ambition.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started her own fruit stand in the marketplace. She undercut her competitors, selling slightly bruised fruit at a lower price, and used her profits to buy better quality produce. Her business thrived, but she felt a pang of guilt watching other vendors struggle. She quickly buried the feeling, telling herself it was just business.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled to a neighboring town to buy a wagonload of exotic fruits. She negotiated a low price, knowing the fruit would fetch a fortune in her own town. As she loaded the wagon, she overheard the farmer lamenting his losses. Della felt a flicker of empathy, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the profit she would make.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy her entire fruit business for a substantial sum. Della hesitated, torn between the security the offer represented and the thrill of building something herself. She ultimately declined, choosing the risk and reward of independence over the comfort of stability.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
