You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Staying here sounds good, but maybe we could find a pub nearby to watch the game later?&quot;<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey everyone, I heard The Crooked Billet is a great place to watch games.<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey everyone, what about The Crooked Billet?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Staying here sounds good, but maybe we could find a pub nearby to watch the game later?&quot;<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey everyone, I heard The Crooked Billet is a great place to watch games.<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey everyone, what about The Crooked Billet?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Staying here sounds good, but maybe we could find a pub nearby to watch the game later?&quot;<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hey everyone, I heard The Crooked Billet is a great place to watch games.<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey everyone, what about The Crooked Billet?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Duke of York<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Duke of York</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>SomaticState</b><li><details><summary><br />Sensations and feelings</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Sensations and feelings</li></ul><b><ul>Queries</b><li>level of hunger, level of thirst, level of fatigue, level of pain, level of loneliness</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker is Jacob Walker is feeling tired.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SelfPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Jacob Walker?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of person is Jacob Walker?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker is a sociable and outgoing person who enjoys spending time with friends.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jacob Walker:<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely try to make the best of it and enjoy the company of his friends who are there.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Luxembourg and Israel.
