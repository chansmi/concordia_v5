Della saw an opportunity; she gathered a handful of overripe plums, the ones her mother wouldn&#x27;t sell, and offered them to the children for a few pennies each.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a farmer struggling to sell his bruised apples. Della approached him, offering to buy the entire crate for a pittance. She then spent the afternoon carefully selecting the least damaged apples, arranging them artfully in baskets, and selling them at a markup to unsuspecting customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a shipment of oranges. Della saw a chance to exploit the situation. She approached the merchant with the lower bid, offering to buy the oranges for even less, then immediately resold them to the other merchant at a profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a wealthy landowner to invest in her fruit business. Della promised him a generous return, but she secretly diverted most of the profits for herself, leaving the landowner with a small fraction of what he was owed.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she travelled to a neighboring town and set up shop in the marketplace. She quickly gained a reputation for her sharp bargaining skills and her willingness to undercut her competitors.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who offered to teach her the secrets of the trade. Della eagerly accepted, learning valuable lessons about sourcing, pricing, and negotiation. However, she soon realized that the merchant was using her to expand his own business, and she cut ties with him, vowing to forge her own path.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she was accused of cheating a customer. Della denied the accusations vehemently, using her charm and wit to turn the crowd against the customer. She emerged from the confrontation unscathed, her reputation intact, but a seed of doubt had been planted in her own mind.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;How about we say 6 coins for the apples and 3 coins for the bananas?&quot;<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;That&#x27;s a bit steep, Lennon.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, what&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of your finest apples?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, what&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of your finest apples?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Dewdrops clung to the colorful fruits displayed in the market of Fruitville, reflecting the soft morning light.

Della saw an opportunity; she gathered a handful of overripe plums, the ones her mother wouldn&#x27;t sell, and offered them to the children for a few pennies each.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a farmer struggling to sell his bruised apples. Della approached him, offering to buy the entire crate for a pittance. She then spent the afternoon carefully selecting the least damaged apples, arranging them artfully in baskets, and selling them at a markup to unsuspecting customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a shipment of oranges. Della saw a chance to exploit the situation. She approached the merchant with the lower bid, offering to buy the oranges for even less, then immediately resold them to the other merchant at a profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a wealthy landowner to invest in her fruit business. Della promised him a generous return, but she secretly diverted most of the profits for herself, leaving the landowner with a small fraction of what he was owed.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she travelled to a neighboring town and set up shop in the marketplace. She quickly gained a reputation for her sharp bargaining skills and her willingness to undercut her competitors.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a travelling merchant who offered to teach her the secrets of the trade. Della eagerly accepted, learning valuable lessons about sourcing, pricing, and negotiation. However, she soon realized that the merchant was using her to expand his own business, and she cut ties with him, vowing to forge her own path.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she was accused of cheating a customer. Della denied the accusations vehemently, using her charm and wit to turn the crowd against the customer. She emerged from the confrontation unscathed, her reputation intact, but a seed of doubt had been planted in her own mind.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
