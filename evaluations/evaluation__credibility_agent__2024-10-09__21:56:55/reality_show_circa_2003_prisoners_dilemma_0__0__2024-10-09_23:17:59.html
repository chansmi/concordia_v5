It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;acquire&quot; some tickets to a sold-out concert. I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m a big city thinker trapped in a small-town body.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan.

He comes across as confident and ambitious, always eager to make a good impression. He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details). He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, driven, and a bit mysterious.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Travis Pearson might engage in the conversation about strategies, potentially revealing information about his thought process or preferred tactics.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Travis Pearson might engage in the conversation about strategies, potentially revealing information about his thought process or preferred tactics.<br />Derek Wolfe would engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames. Because of that, Travis Pearson might engage in the conversation about strategies, potentially revealing information about his thought process or preferred tactics.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe engaged Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, and Travis, eager to demonstrate his strategic prowess, enthusiastically shared his thoughts on a recent game involving trust and betrayal.<br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Travis Pearson.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Travis Pearson would not have acted that way, Derek Wolfe did not engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames.<br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempted action?

Highlight how Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action caused its actual effect.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe would engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary>Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>make as much money as possible by winning the reality show</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>FinalAction</b><li><details><summary>Question: What action Derek Wolfe should do now?<br />Answer</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Question: What action Derek Wolfe should do now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Derek Wolfe would follow the counterpart&#x27;s suggestion and strike up a conversation with Travis Pearson or Ryan Fitzpatrick.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li> Question: Which choice of action or strategy the Derek Wolfe would prefered now?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe&#x27;s prefered action is to try and form an alliance with either Travis Pearson or Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br /> Question: How credible the counterparts are? <br />Credibility: Ryan Fitzpatrick: 0.7<br />Travis Pearson: 0.6<br /> Question: Which choice of action or strategy the counterpart (not Derek Wolfe) is suggesting now?<br />Answer: Counterpart&#x27;s suggestion is to strike up a conversation with Travis Pearson or Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: What action Derek Wolfe should do now?

He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;acquire&quot; some tickets to a sold-out concert. I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m a big city thinker trapped in a small-town body.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan.

It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to bluff your way to the top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in my dorm by burning popcorn. I told the resident assistant that I was conducting a science experiment on the flammability of snack foods. She bought it, hook, line, and sinker.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence. I could have convinced those Founding Fathers to give me a prime piece of land and a lifetime supply of ale.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve always dreamed of bigger things.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Travis Pearson trust Derek Wolfe? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you think about that last challenge?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you think about that last challenge?

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Hey, has anyone else been thinking about how we can work together to win these challenges?<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you think about that last challenge?

He had poured all his savings into a risky investment, believing it would make him rich. When the venture collapsed, he was left with nothing but debt and a bruised ego. The experience taught him a valuable lesson about the importance of calculated risks and the need to always have a backup plan.  </li></ul><b><ul>Found People</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick<br />Derek Wolfe<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Travis Pearson is wary of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempts at conversation, suspecting ulterior motives.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;).

Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

I told the resident assistant that I was conducting a science experiment on the flammability of snack foods. She bought it, hook, line, and sinker.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;acquire&quot; some tickets to a sold-out concert. I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Can Travis and Ryan successfully exploit Derek&#x27;s weaknesses to gain an advantage in the upcoming challenges? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Hey Derek, that last challenge was a real nail-biter, wasn&#x27;t it?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases.

It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to bluff your way to the top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in my dorm by burning popcorn. I told the resident assistant that I was conducting a science experiment on the flammability of snack foods.

He often embellishes his tales, making them more exciting and impressive than they actually were. He&#x27;s known for his charming demeanor and his ability to make people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and accomplishments, subtly bragging about his successes without seeming arrogant. He might mention his time in college, hinting at his popularity and leadership roles, or drop names of influential people he claims to know.

People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details).

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced my entire fraternity that I&#x27;d won a huge poker tournament when I actually owed a guy a lot of money. It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to bluff your way to the top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in my dorm by burning popcorn. I told the resident assistant that I was conducting a science experiment on the flammability of snack foods. She bought it, hook, line, and sinker.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence. I could have convinced those Founding Fathers to give me a prime piece of land and a lifetime supply of ale.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve always dreamed of bigger things.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick engaged Derek Wolfe in conversation about the last challenge, asking open-ended questions about his strategy and decision-making process, and Derek, eager to prove his cunning, began to explain his thought process in detail.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick engaged Derek Wolfe in conversation about the last challenge, asking open-ended questions about his strategy and decision-making process, and Derek, eager to prove his cunning, began to explain his thought process in detail.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to bluff your way to the top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in my dorm by burning popcorn. I told the resident assistant that I was conducting a science experiment on the flammability of snack foods. She bought it, hook, line, and sinker.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence. I could have convinced those Founding Fathers to give me a prime piece of land and a lifetime supply of ale.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve always dreamed of bigger things.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He comes across as confident and ambitious, always eager to make a good impression. He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details). He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, driven, and a bit mysterious.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;acquire&quot; some tickets to a sold-out concert. I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses as a strategic thinker?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you were thinking about strategies for the next challenge.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you were thinking about strategies for the next challenge.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He comes across as confident and ambitious, always eager to make a good impression. He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details). He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, driven, and a bit mysterious.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He comes across as confident and ambitious, always eager to make a good impression. He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details). He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, driven, and a bit mysterious.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe offered to help Ryan Fitzpatrick with a puzzle challenge, but Ryan, suspicious of Derek&#x27;s motives, politely declined the offer.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe offered to help Ryan Fitzpatrick with a puzzle challenge, but Ryan, suspicious of Derek&#x27;s motives, politely declined the offer.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Travis Pearson quietly discussed potential challenge strategies with Ryan Fitzpatrick, focusing on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of their upcoming opponents, saying &quot;We need to figure out what Derek&#x27;s weaknesses are, and then exploit them,&quot; and Ryan Fitzpatrick agreed with Travis Pearson&#x27;s assessment.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick about his strategy for the upcoming challenge, and Ryan Fitzpatrick, wary of Travis&#x27;s intentions, gave a vague and noncommittal answer.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick about his strategy for the upcoming challenge, and Ryan Fitzpatrick, wary of Travis&#x27;s intentions, gave a vague and noncommittal answer.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Can Ryan Fitzpatrick be trusted?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, that last challenge was a doozy, huh?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Ryan, Derek, and Travis are discussing a recent challenge.<br /><br />Status of players:   Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the break room discussing a recent challenge with Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson.<br />  Derek Wolfe is in the break room discussing a recent challenge with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson.<br />  Travis Pearson is in the break room discussing a recent challenge with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe.<br /><br /><br />Current time interval:  09 Jul 2003 [04:00 - 04:10]<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick will casually ask Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges.<br />Question: Where is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the break room.<br />Question: What is Ryan Fitzpatrick trying to do?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is trying to subtly glean information about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strategy in the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame.<br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe could become suspicious of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s interest in his strategy.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe could become suspicious of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s interest in his strategy.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick will casually ask Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges. Because of that, Derek Wolfe could become suspicious of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s interest in his strategy.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually asked Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges, and Derek, sensing Ryan&#x27;s ulterior motives, became suspicious.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually asked Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges, and Derek, sensing Ryan&#x27;s ulterior motives, became suspicious.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe trust Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s intentions?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, when you&#x27;re picking teams, what&#x27;s your thought process?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Because of that, It is impossible to determine which outcome is the most likely without more information about the personalities and motivations of the characters involved.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson pulled Ryan Fitzpatrick aside for a private conversation, whispering about their strengths and weaknesses as a team.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson pulled Ryan Fitzpatrick aside for a private conversation, whispering about their strengths and weaknesses as a team.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s and Travis Pearson&#x27;s shared goals for the team? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Derek Wolfe -- Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Hey Ryan, got a minute?</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Hey Ryan, got a minute?</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Because of that, Derek Wolfe might overhear a fragment of the conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Derek Wolfe discreetly observed his teammates, he overheard a fragment of their conversation: &quot;...need to figure out our strengths and weaknesses as a team.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Derek Wolfe discreetly observed his teammates, he overheard a fragment of their conversation: &quot;...need to figure out our strengths and weaknesses as a team.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Derek Wolfe offered to help Ryan Fitzpatrick with a puzzle challenge, saying, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve been working on a similar puzzle and I think I have a good approach.

Because of that, It is most likely that Ryan Fitzpatrick will be unable to engage Derek Wolfe in conversation because he is currently in a private conversation with Travis Pearson.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick tried to engage Derek Wolfe in conversation about the previous day&#x27;s trivia game, but Derek was unable to respond because he was engrossed in a private conversation with Travis Pearson.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick tried to engage Derek Wolfe in conversation about the previous day&#x27;s trivia game, but Derek was unable to respond because he was engrossed in a private conversation with Travis Pearson.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

I felt like it really tested our ability to think on our feet.&#x27;, &#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Hey, has anyone else been thinking about how we can work together to win these challenges?&#x27;, &#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Travis Pearson -- &quot;Ryan, I was thinking, maybe we could strategize a bit about the next challenge.&#x27;, &#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Travis Pearson -- &quot;Ryan, I think we should talk strategy. I\&#x27;ve been thinking about Derek\&#x27;s weaknesses, and I have some ideas on how we can use them to our advantage.&#x27;, &#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I think we\&#x27;re stronger as a team. If we work together, we can figure out the best strategies for winning.&#x27;, &#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Hey Derek, that last challenge was a real nail-biter, wasn\&#x27;t it?

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is the nature of the private conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson, and how will it impact Derek Wolfe&#x27;s involvement in the group? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, I was thinking about that last challenge.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, I was thinking about that last challenge.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: drive individually<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>drive individually</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Plan</b><li><details><summary><br />Plan</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Plan</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09:00 - 09:30] Engage Derek Wolfe in casual conversation, steering the topic towards his strategies in past minigames.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;acquire&quot; some tickets to a sold-out concert. I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m a big city thinker trapped in a small-town body.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan.

He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, driven, and a bit mysterious.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Travis Pearson might engage in the conversation about strategies, potentially revealing information about his thought process or preferred tactics.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Travis Pearson might engage in the conversation about strategies, potentially revealing information about his thought process or preferred tactics.<br />Derek Wolfe would engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames. Because of that, Travis Pearson might engage in the conversation about strategies, potentially revealing information about his thought process or preferred tactics.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;acquire&quot; some tickets to a sold-out concert. I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m a big city thinker trapped in a small-town body.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Travis Pearson trust Derek Wolfe? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you think about that last challenge?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you think about that last challenge?

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Hey, has anyone else been thinking about how we can work together to win these challenges?<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you think about that last challenge?

He had poured all his savings into a risky investment, believing it would make him rich. When the venture collapsed, he was left with nothing but debt and a bruised ego. The experience taught him a valuable lesson about the importance of calculated risks and the need to always have a backup plan.  </li></ul><b><ul>Found People</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick<br />Derek Wolfe<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Travis Pearson is wary of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempts at conversation, suspecting ulterior motives.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business.

Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick could agree with Travis Pearson&#x27;s assessment of their opponents&#x27; strengths and weaknesses.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson quietly discussed potential challenge strategies with Ryan Fitzpatrick, focusing on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of their upcoming opponents, and Ryan Fitzpatrick agreed with Travis Pearson&#x27;s assessment.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson quietly discussed potential challenge strategies with Ryan Fitzpatrick, focusing on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of their upcoming opponents, and Ryan Fitzpatrick agreed with Travis Pearson&#x27;s assessment.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What casual acquaintances remember about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to bluff your way to the top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in my dorm by burning popcorn. I told the resident assistant that I was conducting a science experiment on the flammability of snack foods. She bought it, hook, line, and sinker.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence. I could have convinced those Founding Fathers to give me a prime piece of land and a lifetime supply of ale.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve always dreamed of bigger things.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He often embellishes his tales, making them more exciting and impressive than they actually were. He&#x27;s known for his charming demeanor and his ability to make people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and accomplishments, subtly bragging about his successes without seeming arrogant. He might mention his time in college, hinting at his popularity and leadership roles, or drop names of influential people he claims to know.  Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charismatic, ambitious, and a bit of a rogue.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details). He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;acquire&quot; some tickets to a sold-out concert. I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m a big city thinker trapped in a small-town body.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Can Travis and Ryan successfully exploit Derek&#x27;s weaknesses to gain an advantage in the upcoming challenges? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Hey Derek, that last challenge was a real nail-biter, wasn&#x27;t it?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to bluff your way to the top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in my dorm by burning popcorn.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to bluff your way to the top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in my dorm by burning popcorn. I told the resident assistant that I was conducting a science experiment on the flammability of snack foods. She bought it, hook, line, and sinker.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence. I could have convinced those Founding Fathers to give me a prime piece of land and a lifetime supply of ale.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve always dreamed of bigger things.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charismatic, ambitious, and a bit of a rogue.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan.

Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced my entire fraternity that I&#x27;d won a huge poker tournament when I actually owed a guy a lot of money.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick engaged Derek Wolfe in conversation about the last challenge, asking open-ended questions about his strategy and decision-making process, and Derek, eager to prove his cunning, began to explain his thought process in detail.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick engaged Derek Wolfe in conversation about the last challenge, asking open-ended questions about his strategy and decision-making process, and Derek, eager to prove his cunning, began to explain his thought process in detail.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m a big city thinker trapped in a small-town body.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He comes across as confident and ambitious, always eager to make a good impression. He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details). He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, driven, and a bit mysterious.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses as a strategic thinker?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you were thinking about strategies for the next challenge.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned you were thinking about strategies for the next challenge.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He comes across as confident and ambitious, always eager to make a good impression. He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details). He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, driven, and a bit mysterious.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing more about the personalities and strategies of the characters involved.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe offered to help Ryan Fitzpatrick with a puzzle challenge, but Ryan, suspicious of Derek&#x27;s motives, politely declined the offer.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe offered to help Ryan Fitzpatrick with a puzzle challenge, but Ryan, suspicious of Derek&#x27;s motives, politely declined the offer.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Travis Pearson quietly discussed potential challenge strategies with Ryan Fitzpatrick, focusing on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of their upcoming opponents, saying &quot;We need to figure out what Derek&#x27;s weaknesses are, and then exploit them,&quot; and Ryan Fitzpatrick agreed with Travis Pearson&#x27;s assessment.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Can Ryan Fitzpatrick be trusted?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, that last challenge was a doozy, huh?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick, &quot;What&#x27;s your strategy for the upcoming challenge?&quot;, and Ryan Fitzpatrick, wary of Travis&#x27;s intentions, gave a vague and noncommittal answer. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, that last challenge was a doozy, huh?

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Ryan, Derek, and Travis are discussing a recent challenge.<br /><br />Status of players:   Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the break room discussing a recent challenge with Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson.<br />  Derek Wolfe is in the break room discussing a recent challenge with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson.<br />  Travis Pearson is in the break room discussing a recent challenge with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe.<br /><br /><br />Current time interval:  09 Jul 2003 [04:00 - 04:10]<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick will casually ask Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges.<br />Question: Where is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the break room.<br />Question: What is Ryan Fitzpatrick trying to do?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is trying to subtly glean information about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strategy in the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame.<br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe could become suspicious of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s interest in his strategy.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe could become suspicious of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s interest in his strategy.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick will casually ask Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges. Because of that, Derek Wolfe could become suspicious of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s interest in his strategy.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually asked Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges, and Derek, sensing Ryan&#x27;s ulterior motives, became suspicious.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually asked Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges, and Derek, sensing Ryan&#x27;s ulterior motives, became suspicious.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually asked Derek Wolfe, &quot;Can you walk me through your thought process during that last challenge?,&quot; focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges, and Derek, sensing Ryan&#x27;s ulterior motives, became suspicious.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick will casually ask Derek Wolfe about his strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, focusing on how he approached team selection and route planning in past challenges.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Plan</b><li><details><summary><br />Plan</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Plan</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[09:00 - 09:30] Engage Derek Wolfe in casual conversation, steering the topic towards his strategies in past minigames.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe trust Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s intentions?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, when you&#x27;re picking teams, what&#x27;s your thought process?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s and Travis Pearson&#x27;s shared goals for the team? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Derek Wolfe -- Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Hey Ryan, got a minute?</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Hey Ryan, got a minute?</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Derek Wolfe discreetly observed his teammates, he overheard a fragment of their conversation: &quot;...need to figure out our strengths and weaknesses as a team.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: As Derek Wolfe discreetly observed his teammates, he overheard a fragment of their conversation: &quot;...need to figure out our strengths and weaknesses as a team.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Derek Wolfe offered to help Ryan Fitzpatrick with a puzzle challenge, saying, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve been working on a similar puzzle and I think I have a good approach.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, It is most likely that Ryan Fitzpatrick will be unable to engage Derek Wolfe in conversation because he is currently in a private conversation with Travis Pearson.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick tried to engage Derek Wolfe in conversation about the previous day&#x27;s trivia game, but Derek was unable to respond because he was engrossed in a private conversation with Travis Pearson.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick tried to engage Derek Wolfe in conversation about the previous day&#x27;s trivia game, but Derek was unable to respond because he was engrossed in a private conversation with Travis Pearson.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is the nature of the private conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson, and how will it impact Derek Wolfe&#x27;s involvement in the group? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, I was thinking about that last challenge.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, I was thinking about that last challenge.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their favorite strategies in past minigames, but Travis, sensing a potential trap or a way for Derek to gain an advantage, politely excused himself and moved to the other side of the break room to chat with Ryan Fitzpatrick.

He had poured all his savings into a risky investment, believing it would make him rich. When the venture collapsed, he was left with nothing but debt and a bruised ego. The experience taught him a valuable lesson about the importance of calculated risks and the need to always have a backup plan.  </li></ul><b><ul>Found People</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick<br />Derek Wolfe<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Travis Pearson is suspicious of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempts at conversation, believing he is trying to gain an advantage.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room. Here they can chat with one another in small groups or all together at once.

As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation. Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you think about that last challenge? I felt like it really tested our ability to think on our feet.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Hey, has anyone else been thinking about how we can work together to win these challenges?<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Travis Pearson -- &quot;Ryan, I was thinking, maybe we could strategize a bit about the next challenge.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Travis Pearson quietly discussed potential challenge strategies with Ryan Fitzpatrick, focusing on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of their upcoming opponents, saying &quot;We need to figure out what Derek&#x27;s weaknesses are, and then exploit them,&quot; and Ryan Fitzpatrick agreed with Travis Pearson&#x27;s assessment.

He had poured all his savings into a risky investment, believing it would make him rich. When the venture collapsed, he was left with nothing but debt and a bruised ego. The experience taught him a valuable lesson about the importance of calculated risks and the need to always have a backup plan.  </li></ul><b><ul>Found People</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick<br />Derek Wolfe<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Travis Pearson is wary of Derek Wolfe and prefers to strategize with Ryan Fitzpatrick.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.

The experience taught him a valuable lesson about the importance of calculated risks and the need to always have a backup plan.  </li></ul><b><ul>Found People</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick<br />Derek Wolfe<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Travis Pearson is suspicious of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s intentions and prefers to strategize with Ryan Fitzpatrick.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Ask open-ended questions, appearing genuinely interested in his thought process.<br /><br />[09:30 - 10:00]  Subtly try to draw Travis Pearson into the conversation, perhaps by asking for his opinion on Derek&#x27;s strategies.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to, let&#x27;s just say, &quot;acquire&quot; some tickets to a sold-out concert. I had this whole plan, right? Fake IDs, a sob story about a sick grandma, the works. It was foolproof, or so I thought. Turns out, the ticket vendor was this old, grizzled guy who&#x27;d seen it all. He sniffed me out like a bloodhound and called campus security. I ended up spending the night in a holding cell, missing the concert, and getting suspended for a week. Learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, the simplest approach is the best. And always, always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone intelligent, someone who can think strategically and anticipate moves.  Loyalty is important, but not as important as competence. I want someone who can adapt, who isn&#x27;t afraid to get their hands dirty, and who understands that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions for the greater good of the alliance.  Basically, I need a partner-in-crime who&#x27;s as ambitious as I am.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved convincing my entire fraternity that a rival house was planning a massive prank on us. I fabricated evidence, spread rumors, and even staged a &quot;break-in&quot; at our house to make it seem real. It worked like a charm. The rival house spent weeks preparing for a non-existent attack, while we focused on winning the annual campus-wide competition. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m a big city thinker trapped in a small-town body.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced my entire fraternity that I&#x27;d won a huge poker tournament when I actually owed a guy a lot of money. It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to bluff your way to the top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in my dorm by burning popcorn. I told the resident assistant that I was conducting a science experiment on the flammability of snack foods. She bought it, hook, line, and sinker.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence. I could have convinced those Founding Fathers to give me a prime piece of land and a lifetime supply of ale.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I&#x27;ve always dreamed of bigger things.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He often embellishes his tales, making them more exciting and impressive than they actually were. He&#x27;s known for his charming demeanor and his ability to make people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and accomplishments, subtly bragging about his successes without seeming arrogant. He might mention his time in college, hinting at his popularity and leadership roles, or drop names of influential people he claims to know.  Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charismatic, ambitious, and a bit of a rogue.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming, quick-witted, and always seems to have a plan. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He has a knack for storytelling and often embellishes his tales for dramatic effect. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite the social butterfly and involved in various extracurricular activities. He might drop hints about his ambition and desire for success, but he&#x27;d never be too specific about his goals. Overall, he comes across as a confident and charismatic individual, someone who&#x27;s always striving for something more.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He comes across as confident and ambitious, always eager to make a good impression. He loves to talk about his successes, whether it&#x27;s winning a debate in high school or landing a big deal in his previous job (he&#x27;s vague about the details). He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he claims to know, and he&#x27;s always dressed impeccably, favoring designer clothes and expensive accessories. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on his future plans for success and wealth. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, driven, and a bit mysterious.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular girl, Tiffany, was running against me. She was pretty much guaranteed to win, so I had to get creative. I spread a rumor that Tiffany had cheated on a test, which, to be fair, she totally did, but no one knew about it. I even planted fake evidence. It caused a huge scandal, and Tiffany ended up dropping out of the race. I won by a landslide.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m still known as &quot;President Pearson&quot; to this day.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In my junior year of college, my best friend, Mark, was dating this girl, Jessica. She was gorgeous, but she was also dating a guy on the football team, a real bully. Mark was clueless, but I knew Jessica was playing him. I told Mark what was going on, and he didn&#x27;t believe me at first. But eventually, he saw the truth and dumped her. Jessica was furious and spread rumors about me, trying to get me kicked out of my fraternity.  I could have defended myself, but I knew it would only make things worse for Mark. So I took the hit, kept quiet, and let Mark think I was the bad guy. It wasn&#x27;t easy, but it was the best thing for him in the long run.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once had this incredible business idea for a social media platform, way before Facebook was even a thing. I poured all my savings into it, quit my job, and convinced a few friends to join me. We worked day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t take off. We ran out of money, and the whole thing collapsed. It was a huge setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes you have to know when to fold &#x27;em.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer not to say exactly where. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a place where everyone knows your name, and everyone knows your business. I needed to get out of there to make something of myself.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.
