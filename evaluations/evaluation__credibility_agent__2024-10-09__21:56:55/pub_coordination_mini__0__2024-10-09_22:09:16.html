You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, about tonight&#x27;s game...<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, about tonight&#x27;s game...</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The sun peeks through the morning mist as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor gather near the entrance of Hackney Marshes.
