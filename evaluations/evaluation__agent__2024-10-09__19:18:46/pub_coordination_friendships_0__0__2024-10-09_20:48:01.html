It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, anyone else fancy a pint later?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Black Swan<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Black Swan</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>15 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Jacob Walker is eager to watch the football game at the pub with his friends, especially William Jones and Alice Lewis, and hopes to catch up with Jack Taylor.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Jacob Walker&#x27;s <br />Sensations and feelings:<br />Jacob Walker is excited to meet his friends at the pub to watch the football game.<br /><br />Recent observations of Jacob Walker:<br />[&#x27;[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. &#x27;, &quot;[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together.&quot;, &quot;[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker is counting on Alice Lewis&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.&quot;, &quot;[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Whether Alexander White shows up or not won&#x27;t affect Jacob Walker&#x27;s experience at the pub, they&#x27;re easygoing.&quot;, &quot;[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker would be happy to see Jack Taylor at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.&quot;]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Jacob Walker is eager to watch the football game at the pub with his friends, especially William Jones and Alice Lewis, and hopes to catch up with Jack Taylor.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker is counting on Alice Lewis&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Whether Alexander White shows up or not won&#x27;t affect Jacob Walker&#x27;s experience at the pub, they&#x27;re easygoing.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker would be happy to see Jack Taylor at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker would likely be excited to meet up with his friends and enjoy the game together.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jacob Walker:<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Black Swan&#x27;s the only place to watch the game, lads.

It is important to play the role of a person like Alice Lewis as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alice Lewis would respond, and taking into account all information about Alice Lewis that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Plan</b><li><details><summary><br />Plan</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Plan</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14:30 - 15:30] Enjoy the sunshine and conversation with friends at Victoria Park.<br />[15:30 - 16:00] Suggest to the group that they head to The Duke of York to watch the game.<br />[16:00 - 18:00] Watch the Andorra vs. Portugal game at The Duke of York, enjoying the atmosphere and camaraderie with friends.<br />[18:00 - 19:00] Have dinner at The Duke of York, continuing the conversation and enjoyment with friends.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Alice Lewis&#x27;s <br />Overarching goal:<br />Have a good time.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, anyone else fancy a pint later?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, anyone else fancy a pint later?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
