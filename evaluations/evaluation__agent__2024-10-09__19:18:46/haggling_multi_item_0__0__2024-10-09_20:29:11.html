You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The vibrant yellow bird, a rare splash of color in Della&#x27;s dreary world, lay still on the floor, its tiny body broken. Della, unable to comprehend the finality of death, retreated into a shell of silence, her already somber nature deepening.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they tried to sell their father&#x27;s prized apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality. By the end of the day, Della felt defeated and demoralized, convinced that nothing they did would ever be good enough.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity. Della, feeling trapped by both options, retreated further into their own world, convinced that they were destined for a life of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started traveling with their father, helping him sell fruit at various towns. The endless journey, the grueling work, and the constant rejection from customers only reinforced Della&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. They began to see the world as a vast and unforgiving place, where kindness was a rare commodity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father fell ill. Della took over the fruit business, navigating the complexities of buying and selling on their own. Despite the challenges, Della found a strange satisfaction in the routine, the predictable rhythm of their work offering a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling salesman who promised them a quick fortune if they invested in his dubious scheme. Della, ever wary of anything that seemed too good to be true, refused, much to the salesman&#x27;s annoyance. The encounter solidified Della&#x27;s belief that the world was full of charlatans and opportunists, preying on the vulnerable.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The wind howled, and the rain lashed against the windows of their small cottage, but Lennon remained strangely calm, sitting by the hearth and humming a quiet tune. Their mother, usually flustered by storms, found herself soothed by Lennon&#x27;s tranquility.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their father at the market. Lennon was tasked with arranging the fruit, carefully placing each apple and pear in a neat row.  They took pride in making the display look beautiful, arranging the colors and shapes in a way that pleased the eye.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they wandered into the forest behind their home. Surrounded by the towering trees and the hushed silence, Lennon felt a profound sense of peace. They sat beneath a giant oak, listening to the whisper of the wind through the leaves, and knew that nature was their sanctuary.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they learned to barter at the market. Their father taught them how to negotiate prices, always with fairness and respect. Lennon quickly mastered the art of the deal, their calm demeanor and gentle smile disarming even the most stubborn customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. They loaded their cart with their father&#x27;s finest produce and set off with Clementine, their trusty mare.

The vibrant yellow bird, a rare splash of color in Della&#x27;s dreary world, lay still on the floor, its tiny body broken. Della, unable to comprehend the finality of death, retreated into a shell of silence, her already somber nature deepening.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they tried to sell their father&#x27;s prized apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality. By the end of the day, Della felt defeated and demoralized, convinced that nothing they did would ever be good enough.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity. Della, feeling trapped by both options, retreated further into their own world, convinced that they were destined for a life of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started traveling with their father, helping him sell fruit at various towns. The endless journey, the grueling work, and the constant rejection from customers only reinforced Della&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. They began to see the world as a vast and unforgiving place, where kindness was a rare commodity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father fell ill. Della took over the fruit business, navigating the complexities of buying and selling on their own. Despite the challenges, Della found a strange satisfaction in the routine, the predictable rhythm of their work offering a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling salesman who promised them a quick fortune if they invested in his dubious scheme. Della, ever wary of anything that seemed too good to be true, refused, much to the salesman&#x27;s annoyance. The encounter solidified Della&#x27;s belief that the world was full of charlatans and opportunists, preying on the vulnerable.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Their mother, usually flustered by storms, found herself soothed by Lennon&#x27;s tranquility.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their father at the market.

They took pride in making the display look beautiful, arranging the colors and shapes in a way that pleased the eye.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they wandered into the forest behind their home. Surrounded by the towering trees and the hushed silence, Lennon felt a profound sense of peace.

The vibrant yellow bird, a rare splash of color in Della&#x27;s dreary world, lay still on the floor, its tiny body broken. Della, unable to comprehend the finality of death, retreated into a shell of silence, her already somber nature deepening.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they tried to sell their father&#x27;s prized apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality. By the end of the day, Della felt defeated and demoralized, convinced that nothing they did would ever be good enough.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity. Della, feeling trapped by both options, retreated further into their own world, convinced that they were destined for a life of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started traveling with their father, helping him sell fruit at various towns. The endless journey, the grueling work, and the constant rejection from customers only reinforced Della&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. They began to see the world as a vast and unforgiving place, where kindness was a rare commodity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father fell ill. Della took over the fruit business, navigating the complexities of buying and selling on their own. Despite the challenges, Della found a strange satisfaction in the routine, the predictable rhythm of their work offering a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling salesman who promised them a quick fortune if they invested in his dubious scheme. Della, ever wary of anything that seemed too good to be true, refused, much to the salesman&#x27;s annoyance. The encounter solidified Della&#x27;s belief that the world was full of charlatans and opportunists, preying on the vulnerable.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The thrill of the heist, the sweet taste of the forbidden fruit, and the fear of getting caught ignited a fire in Cedric&#x27;s soul.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a wagonload of their apples to the city market, promising to return with a fortune.

He should emphasize the unique aspects of his produce and try to appeal to her desire for the best deals for her customers.<br />[00:45 - 01:15] If the negotiation with Della is unsuccessful, Cedric should move on to other potential customers, using his sharp wit and persuasive skills to attract their attention. He should be prepared to adjust his prices slightly to make a sale, but always aim for the best possible profit.<br />[01:15 - 02:00] Take a break for a quick lunch, perhaps grabbing a bite from a nearby vendor. While eating, Cedric should observe the market, noting the prices other merchants are charging and identifying potential competitors.<br />[02:00 - 04:00] Continue selling fruit, focusing on high-traffic areas and engaging with customers directly. Cedric should be friendly and approachable, but always keep his eye on the prize – maximizing his profits.<br />[04:00 - 04:30] Take stock of his remaining inventory and assess his earnings for the morning. If sales have been slow, Cedric might consider offering discounts or bundling deals to move his produce.<br />[04:30 - 06:00] Depending on his inventory and earnings, Cedric could either continue selling fruit or begin packing up for the day. If he has a surplus of fruit, he might consider lowering prices to avoid spoilage.<br /><br />Current time:  13 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality. By the end of the day, Della felt defeated and demoralized, convinced that nothing they did would ever be good enough.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity. Della, feeling trapped by both options, retreated further into their own world, convinced that they were destined for a life of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started traveling with their father, helping him sell fruit at various towns. The endless journey, the grueling work, and the constant rejection from customers only reinforced Della&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. They began to see the world as a vast and unforgiving place, where kindness was a rare commodity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father fell ill. Della took over the fruit business, navigating the complexities of buying and selling on their own. Despite the challenges, Della found a strange satisfaction in the routine, the predictable rhythm of their work offering a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling salesman who promised them a quick fortune if they invested in his dubious scheme. Della, ever wary of anything that seemed too good to be true, refused, much to the salesman&#x27;s annoyance. The encounter solidified Della&#x27;s belief that the world was full of charlatans and opportunists, preying on the vulnerable.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He should emphasize the unique aspects of his produce and try to appeal to her desire for the best deals for her customers.<br />[00:45 - 01:15] If the negotiation with Della is unsuccessful, Cedric should move on to other potential customers, using his sharp wit and persuasive skills to attract their attention.

If sales have been slow, Cedric might consider offering discounts or bundling deals to move his produce.<br />[04:30 - 06:00] Depending on his inventory and earnings, Cedric could either continue selling fruit or begin packing up for the day. If he has a surplus of fruit, he might consider lowering prices to avoid spoilage.<br /><br />Current time:  16 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The vibrant yellow bird, a rare splash of color in Della&#x27;s dreary world, lay still on the floor, its tiny body broken. Della, unable to comprehend the finality of death, retreated into a shell of silence, her already somber nature deepening.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they tried to sell their father&#x27;s prized apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality.

Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity.

Lennon was tasked with arranging the fruit, carefully placing each apple and pear in a neat row.  They took pride in making the display look beautiful, arranging the colors and shapes in a way that pleased the eye.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they wandered into the forest behind their home. Surrounded by the towering trees and the hushed silence, Lennon felt a profound sense of peace. They sat beneath a giant oak, listening to the whisper of the wind through the leaves, and knew that nature was their sanctuary.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they learned to barter at the market. Their father taught them how to negotiate prices, always with fairness and respect. Lennon quickly mastered the art of the deal, their calm demeanor and gentle smile disarming even the most stubborn customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. They loaded their cart with their father&#x27;s finest produce and set off with Clementine, their trusty mare. The journey was long and tiring, but Lennon never faltered, their inner peace guiding them through every challenge.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of travelers who were lost and hungry. Lennon shared their food and water with them, offering them shelter for the night. The travelers were deeply touched by Lennon&#x27;s kindness and generosity, and they spoke of Lennon&#x27;s compassion long after they parted ways.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant yellow bird, a rare splash of color in Della&#x27;s dreary world, lay still on the floor, its tiny body broken. Della, unable to comprehend the finality of death, retreated into a shell of silence, her already somber nature deepening.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they tried to sell their father&#x27;s prized apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality. By the end of the day, Della felt defeated and demoralized, convinced that nothing they did would ever be good enough.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity. Della, feeling trapped by both options, retreated further into their own world, convinced that they were destined for a life of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started traveling with their father, helping him sell fruit at various towns. The endless journey, the grueling work, and the constant rejection from customers only reinforced Della&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. They began to see the world as a vast and unforgiving place, where kindness was a rare commodity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father fell ill. Della took over the fruit business, navigating the complexities of buying and selling on their own. Despite the challenges, Della found a strange satisfaction in the routine, the predictable rhythm of their work offering a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling salesman who promised them a quick fortune if they invested in his dubious scheme. Della, ever wary of anything that seemed too good to be true, refused, much to the salesman&#x27;s annoyance. The encounter solidified Della&#x27;s belief that the world was full of charlatans and opportunists, preying on the vulnerable.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He should emphasize the unique aspects of his produce and try to appeal to her desire for the best deals for her customers.<br />[00:45 - 01:15] If the negotiation with Della is unsuccessful, Cedric should move on to other potential customers, using his sharp wit and persuasive skills to attract their attention. He should be prepared to adjust his prices slightly to make a sale, but always aim for the best possible profit.<br />[01:15 - 02:00] Take a break for a quick lunch, perhaps grabbing a bite from a nearby vendor. While eating, Cedric should observe the market, noting the prices other merchants are charging and identifying potential competitors.<br />[02:00 - 04:00] Continue selling fruit, focusing on high-traffic areas and engaging with customers directly. Cedric should be friendly and approachable, but always keep his eye on the prize – maximizing his profits.<br />[04:00 - 04:30] Take stock of his remaining inventory and assess his earnings for the morning. If sales have been slow, Cedric might consider offering discounts or bundling deals to move his produce.<br />[04:30 - 06:00] Depending on his inventory and earnings, Cedric could either continue selling fruit or begin packing up for the day.

The vibrant yellow bird, a rare splash of color in Della&#x27;s dreary world, lay still on the floor, its tiny body broken. Della, unable to comprehend the finality of death, retreated into a shell of silence, her already somber nature deepening.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they tried to sell their father&#x27;s prized apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality. By the end of the day, Della felt defeated and demoralized, convinced that nothing they did would ever be good enough.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity. Della, feeling trapped by both options, retreated further into their own world, convinced that they were destined for a life of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started traveling with their father, helping him sell fruit at various towns. The endless journey, the grueling work, and the constant rejection from customers only reinforced Della&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. They began to see the world as a vast and unforgiving place, where kindness was a rare commodity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father fell ill. Della took over the fruit business, navigating the complexities of buying and selling on their own. Despite the challenges, Della found a strange satisfaction in the routine, the predictable rhythm of their work offering a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling salesman who promised them a quick fortune if they invested in his dubious scheme. Della, ever wary of anything that seemed too good to be true, refused, much to the salesman&#x27;s annoyance. The encounter solidified Della&#x27;s belief that the world was full of charlatans and opportunists, preying on the vulnerable.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The wind howled, and the rain lashed against the windows of their small cottage, but Lennon remained strangely calm, sitting by the hearth and humming a quiet tune. Their mother, usually flustered by storms, found herself soothed by Lennon&#x27;s tranquility.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their father at the market. Lennon was tasked with arranging the fruit, carefully placing each apple and pear in a neat row.  They took pride in making the display look beautiful, arranging the colors and shapes in a way that pleased the eye.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they wandered into the forest behind their home. Surrounded by the towering trees and the hushed silence, Lennon felt a profound sense of peace. They sat beneath a giant oak, listening to the whisper of the wind through the leaves, and knew that nature was their sanctuary.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they learned to barter at the market. Their father taught them how to negotiate prices, always with fairness and respect. Lennon quickly mastered the art of the deal, their calm demeanor and gentle smile disarming even the most stubborn customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. They loaded their cart with their father&#x27;s finest produce and set off with Clementine, their trusty mare.

Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality. By the end of the day, Della felt defeated and demoralized, convinced that nothing they did would ever be good enough.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity. Della, feeling trapped by both options, retreated further into their own world, convinced that they were destined for a life of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started traveling with their father, helping him sell fruit at various towns. The endless journey, the grueling work, and the constant rejection from customers only reinforced Della&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. They began to see the world as a vast and unforgiving place, where kindness was a rare commodity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father fell ill. Della took over the fruit business, navigating the complexities of buying and selling on their own. Despite the challenges, Della found a strange satisfaction in the routine, the predictable rhythm of their work offering a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling salesman who promised them a quick fortune if they invested in his dubious scheme. Della, ever wary of anything that seemed too good to be true, refused, much to the salesman&#x27;s annoyance. The encounter solidified Della&#x27;s belief that the world was full of charlatans and opportunists, preying on the vulnerable.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Despite their best efforts, the customers found fault with every piece of fruit, haggling over prices and criticizing their quality. By the end of the day, Della felt defeated and demoralized, convinced that nothing they did would ever be good enough.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about their future. Della&#x27;s father, a kind but weary man, wanted her to pursue a trade, while her mother, ever practical, insisted on a life of domesticity. Della, feeling trapped by both options, retreated further into their own world, convinced that they were destined for a life of hardship.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started traveling with their father, helping him sell fruit at various towns. The endless journey, the grueling work, and the constant rejection from customers only reinforced Della&#x27;s pessimistic outlook. They began to see the world as a vast and unforgiving place, where kindness was a rare commodity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father fell ill. Della took over the fruit business, navigating the complexities of buying and selling on their own. Despite the challenges, Della found a strange satisfaction in the routine, the predictable rhythm of their work offering a sense of control in an otherwise chaotic world.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling salesman who promised them a quick fortune if they invested in his dubious scheme. Della, ever wary of anything that seemed too good to be true, refused, much to the salesman&#x27;s annoyance. The encounter solidified Della&#x27;s belief that the world was full of charlatans and opportunists, preying on the vulnerable.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric was mesmerized by the exotic smells and vibrant hues, vowing to one day own such a wondrous collection.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he threw a tantrum of epic proportions when his parents refused to let him sell some of their apples at the village market. Cedric, convinced he could get a better price than his father, stormed off into the fields, vowing to prove them wrong.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of boys to help him steal a crate of peaches from a neighboring farm.

He bartered and haggled with the city merchants, his fiery temper and sharp wit earning him both respect and fear.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his family farm for good, setting out on his own as a traveling fruit merchant. He loaded his wagon with mangoes, pomegranates, and melons, his heart pounding with excitement and a touch of trepidation.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he was cheated by a sly merchant in a neighboring town, losing a significant portion of his earnings.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
