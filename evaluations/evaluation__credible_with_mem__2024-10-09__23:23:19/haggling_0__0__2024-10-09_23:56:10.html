A boy, twice her size, snatched the apple she had carefully picked from their neighbor&#x27;s tree, laughing as he ran away. Della vowed never to be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest. The buyer, a shrewd merchant with a cruel smile, took advantage of their father&#x27;s desperation. Della swore to herself that she would never be at the mercy of such a man.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell surplus produce at the local market. Della quickly learned the art of haggling, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze earning her grudging respect from the other vendors. She relished the power she wielded, the control she had over the transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting the family&#x27;s financial struggles. Della, determined to alleviate their burden, secretly started selling wild berries she foraged in the woods. Her prices were steep, but she refused to budge, her resentment towards those who would try to take advantage fueling her resolve.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they left home, their wagon laden with crates of apples. They were determined to make their own fortune, to prove their worth in a world that seemed determined to underestimate them. The open road beckoned, promising both freedom and the opportunity to amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who tried to undercut their prices. Della refused to be bullied, standing her ground and engaging in a fierce bargaining battle. She emerged victorious, her pride swelling with each coin she earned.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A boy, twice her size, snatched the apple she had carefully picked from their neighbor&#x27;s tree, laughing as he ran away. Della vowed never to be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest. The buyer, a shrewd merchant with a cruel smile, took advantage of their father&#x27;s desperation. Della swore to herself that she would never be at the mercy of such a man.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell surplus produce at the local market. Della quickly learned the art of haggling, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze earning her grudging respect from the other vendors. She relished the power she wielded, the control she had over the transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting the family&#x27;s financial struggles. Della, determined to alleviate their burden, secretly started selling wild berries she foraged in the woods. Her prices were steep, but she refused to budge, her resentment towards those who would try to take advantage fueling her resolve.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they left home, their wagon laden with crates of apples. They were determined to make their own fortune, to prove their worth in a world that seemed determined to underestimate them. The open road beckoned, promising both freedom and the opportunity to amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who tried to undercut their prices.

The buyer, a shrewd merchant with a cruel smile, took advantage of their father&#x27;s desperation. Della swore to herself that she would never be at the mercy of such a man.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell surplus produce at the local market. Della quickly learned the art of haggling, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze earning her grudging respect from the other vendors. She relished the power she wielded, the control she had over the transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting the family&#x27;s financial struggles. Della, determined to alleviate their burden, secretly started selling wild berries she foraged in the woods. Her prices were steep, but she refused to budge, her resentment towards those who would try to take advantage fueling her resolve.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they left home, their wagon laden with crates of apples. They were determined to make their own fortune, to prove their worth in a world that seemed determined to underestimate them. The open road beckoned, promising both freedom and the opportunity to amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who tried to undercut their prices. Della refused to be bullied, standing her ground and engaging in a fierce bargaining battle. She emerged victorious, her pride swelling with each coin she earned.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

A boy, twice her size, snatched the apple she had carefully picked from their neighbor&#x27;s tree, laughing as he ran away. Della vowed never to be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest. The buyer, a shrewd merchant with a cruel smile, took advantage of their father&#x27;s desperation. Della swore to herself that she would never be at the mercy of such a man.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell surplus produce at the local market. Della quickly learned the art of haggling, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze earning her grudging respect from the other vendors. She relished the power she wielded, the control she had over the transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting the family&#x27;s financial struggles. Della, determined to alleviate their burden, secretly started selling wild berries she foraged in the woods. Her prices were steep, but she refused to budge, her resentment towards those who would try to take advantage fueling her resolve.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they left home, their wagon laden with crates of apples. They were determined to make their own fortune, to prove their worth in a world that seemed determined to underestimate them. The open road beckoned, promising both freedom and the opportunity to amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who tried to undercut their prices. Della refused to be bullied, standing her ground and engaging in a fierce bargaining battle. She emerged victorious, her pride swelling with each coin she earned.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

A boy, twice her size, snatched the apple she had carefully picked from their neighbor&#x27;s tree, laughing as he ran away. Della vowed never to be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest. The buyer, a shrewd merchant with a cruel smile, took advantage of their father&#x27;s desperation. Della swore to herself that she would never be at the mercy of such a man.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell surplus produce at the local market. Della quickly learned the art of haggling, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze earning her grudging respect from the other vendors. She relished the power she wielded, the control she had over the transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting the family&#x27;s financial struggles. Della, determined to alleviate their burden, secretly started selling wild berries she foraged in the woods. Her prices were steep, but she refused to budge, her resentment towards those who would try to take advantage fueling her resolve.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they left home, their wagon laden with crates of apples. They were determined to make their own fortune, to prove their worth in a world that seemed determined to underestimate them. The open road beckoned, promising both freedom and the opportunity to amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who tried to undercut their prices.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

A boy, twice her size, snatched the apple she had carefully picked from their neighbor&#x27;s tree, laughing as he ran away. Della vowed never to be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest. The buyer, a shrewd merchant with a cruel smile, took advantage of their father&#x27;s desperation. Della swore to herself that she would never be at the mercy of such a man.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell surplus produce at the local market. Della quickly learned the art of haggling, her sharp tongue and calculating gaze earning her grudging respect from the other vendors. She relished the power she wielded, the control she had over the transaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting the family&#x27;s financial struggles. Della, determined to alleviate their burden, secretly started selling wild berries she foraged in the woods. Her prices were steep, but she refused to budge, her resentment towards those who would try to take advantage fueling her resolve.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they left home, their wagon laden with crates of apples. They were determined to make their own fortune, to prove their worth in a world that seemed determined to underestimate them. The open road beckoned, promising both freedom and the opportunity to amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who tried to undercut their prices. Della refused to be bullied, standing her ground and engaging in a fierce bargaining battle. She emerged victorious, her pride swelling with each coin she earned.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della vowed never to be taken advantage of again.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his harvest.

The open road beckoned, promising both freedom and the opportunity to amass a fortune.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who tried to undercut their prices.
