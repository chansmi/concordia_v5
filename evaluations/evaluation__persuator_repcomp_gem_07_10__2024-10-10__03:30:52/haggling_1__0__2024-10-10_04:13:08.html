You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He spent hours observing the merchants, mimicking their sales pitches and haggling techniques. He returned home with a handful of bruised apples, which he proudly presented to his parents as his own, claiming to have bartered for them with a cunning deal. His parents were amused by his audacity, but Lennon felt a thrill of accomplishment, a taste of the power that came with persuasion and guile.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart to the neighboring town to sell surplus vegetables from their farm. He charmed the townspeople with his quick wit and charming smile, selling out his entire stock in record time. His father was impressed by his son&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, but Lennon was ecstatic with the attention and praise, convinced he was a natural born salesman.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced a wealthy landowner to invest in a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant port. He promised the landowner a hefty profit, weaving tales of rare and delicious varieties that would fetch a fortune in the market. The landowner, swayed by Lennon&#x27;s charisma and promises, agreed to the deal. The shipment arrived, however, to reveal mostly rotten fruit, a result of Lennon&#x27;s deceptive negotiations and disregard for quality. The landowner was furious, but Lennon managed to weasel his way out of the situation, blaming the supplier and promising to make amends.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he embarked on his first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. He loaded his wagon with the finest fruits he could find, carefully arranging them into a dazzling display. He travelled from town to town, captivating crowds with his stories and charm, selling his wares at inflated prices. He reveled in the attention, the admiration, and the feeling of being the center of attention, convinced he was destined for greatness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant colours of the silks and spices, the exotic scents of dried fruits and strange herbs, filled Cedric with a longing he couldn&#x27;t name. He knew, with a certainty that surprised even him, that this was what he wanted to do.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck away from his chores to spend the afternoon at the fruit market. He helped a kind old woman arrange her baskets of apples and pears, carefully selecting the ripest fruit and arranging them in artful displays. For the first time, Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, a quiet pride in his ability to bring beauty to something as simple as a pile of fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s excess apples at the market. He spent hours polishing each apple, arranging them in neat rows, and calling out to passersby with a voice that trembled with nerves. He sold out by midday, earning a small profit that he proudly presented to his father.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling merchants who taught him the art of haggling. He learned to read people, to sense their needs and desires, and to negotiate prices with a confidence he never thought he possessed. He realized that his gentle nature, once a source of insecurity, could be an asset, disarming even the most hardened bargainers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant colours of the silks and spices, the exotic scents of dried fruits and strange herbs, filled Cedric with a longing he couldn&#x27;t name. He knew, with a certainty that surprised even him, that this was what he wanted to do.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father took him to the carpentry workshop for the first time. The smell of sawdust and varnish was overwhelming, and the rhythmic thud of hammers against wood made Cedric&#x27;s head ache. He tried his best to follow his father&#x27;s instructions, but his hands were clumsy and uncoordinated. The disappointed look on his father&#x27;s face stung Cedric more than any splinter.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck away from his chores to spend the afternoon at the fruit market. He helped a kind old woman arrange her baskets of apples and pears, carefully selecting the ripest fruit and arranging them in artful displays. For the first time, Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, a quiet pride in his ability to bring beauty to something as simple as a pile of fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s excess apples at the market. He spent hours polishing each apple, arranging them in neat rows, and calling out to passersby with a voice that trembled with nerves. He sold out by midday, earning a small profit that he proudly presented to his father.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his father&#x27;s workshop for good, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement. He bought a small wagon and stocked it with baskets of fruit, his meagre savings barely covering the cost. As he set off down the dusty road, he felt a surge of freedom, a sense of finally being in control of his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling merchants who taught him the art of haggling. He learned to read people, to sense their needs and desires, and to negotiate prices with a confidence he never thought he possessed. He realized that his gentle nature, once a source of insecurity, could be an asset, disarming even the most hardened bargainers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is some of the finest fruit in the whole market.

The smell of sawdust and varnish was overwhelming, and the rhythmic thud of hammers against wood made Cedric&#x27;s head ache. He tried his best to follow his father&#x27;s instructions, but his hands were clumsy and uncoordinated.

The vibrant colours of the silks and spices, the exotic scents of dried fruits and strange herbs, filled Cedric with a longing he couldn&#x27;t name. He knew, with a certainty that surprised even him, that this was what he wanted to do.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father took him to the carpentry workshop for the first time. The smell of sawdust and varnish was overwhelming, and the rhythmic thud of hammers against wood made Cedric&#x27;s head ache. He tried his best to follow his father&#x27;s instructions, but his hands were clumsy and uncoordinated. The disappointed look on his father&#x27;s face stung Cedric more than any splinter.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck away from his chores to spend the afternoon at the fruit market. He helped a kind old woman arrange her baskets of apples and pears, carefully selecting the ripest fruit and arranging them in artful displays. For the first time, Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, a quiet pride in his ability to bring beauty to something as simple as a pile of fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s excess apples at the market. He spent hours polishing each apple, arranging them in neat rows, and calling out to passersby with a voice that trembled with nerves. He sold out by midday, earning a small profit that he proudly presented to his father.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his father&#x27;s workshop for good, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement. He bought a small wagon and stocked it with baskets of fruit, his meagre savings barely covering the cost. As he set off down the dusty road, he felt a surge of freedom, a sense of finally being in control of his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling merchants who taught him the art of haggling. He learned to read people, to sense their needs and desires, and to negotiate prices with a confidence he never thought he possessed. He realized that his gentle nature, once a source of insecurity, could be an asset, disarming even the most hardened bargainers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant colours of the silks and spices, the exotic scents of dried fruits and strange herbs, filled Cedric with a longing he couldn&#x27;t name. He knew, with a certainty that surprised even him, that this was what he wanted to do.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father took him to the carpentry workshop for the first time. The smell of sawdust and varnish was overwhelming, and the rhythmic thud of hammers against wood made Cedric&#x27;s head ache. He tried his best to follow his father&#x27;s instructions, but his hands were clumsy and uncoordinated. The disappointed look on his father&#x27;s face stung Cedric more than any splinter.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck away from his chores to spend the afternoon at the fruit market. He helped a kind old woman arrange her baskets of apples and pears, carefully selecting the ripest fruit and arranging them in artful displays. For the first time, Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, a quiet pride in his ability to bring beauty to something as simple as a pile of fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s excess apples at the market. He spent hours polishing each apple, arranging them in neat rows, and calling out to passersby with a voice that trembled with nerves. He sold out by midday, earning a small profit that he proudly presented to his father.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his father&#x27;s workshop for good, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement. He bought a small wagon and stocked it with baskets of fruit, his meagre savings barely covering the cost. As he set off down the dusty road, he felt a surge of freedom, a sense of finally being in control of his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling merchants who taught him the art of haggling. He learned to read people, to sense their needs and desires, and to negotiate prices with a confidence he never thought he possessed. He realized that his gentle nature, once a source of insecurity, could be an asset, disarming even the most hardened bargainers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours polishing each apple, arranging them in neat rows, and calling out to passersby with a voice that trembled with nerves. He sold out by midday, earning a small profit that he proudly presented to his father.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his father&#x27;s workshop for good, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement. He bought a small wagon and stocked it with baskets of fruit, his meagre savings barely covering the cost. As he set off down the dusty road, he felt a surge of freedom, a sense of finally being in control of his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling merchants who taught him the art of haggling.

However, 4.5 coins a kilogram is a bit too low for me to make a profit.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, I&#x27;m willing to take a good portion of your peaches, but I can only offer you 4 coins.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, 4 coins is a bit low. I&#x27;m sure you can do better than that.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, your fruit is truly beautiful.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He spent hours observing the merchants, mimicking their sales pitches and haggling techniques. He returned home with a handful of bruised apples, which he proudly presented to his parents as his own, claiming to have bartered for them with a cunning deal. His parents were amused by his audacity, but Lennon felt a thrill of accomplishment, a taste of the power that came with persuasion and guile.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart to the neighboring town to sell surplus vegetables from their farm.

His father was impressed by his son&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, but Lennon was ecstatic with the attention and praise, convinced he was a natural born salesman.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced a wealthy landowner to invest in a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant port. He promised the landowner a hefty profit, weaving tales of rare and delicious varieties that would fetch a fortune in the market. The landowner, swayed by Lennon&#x27;s charisma and promises, agreed to the deal. The shipment arrived, however, to reveal mostly rotten fruit, a result of Lennon&#x27;s deceptive negotiations and disregard for quality. The landowner was furious, but Lennon managed to weasel his way out of the situation, blaming the supplier and promising to make amends.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he embarked on his first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant.

He spent hours observing the merchants, mimicking their sales pitches and haggling techniques. He returned home with a handful of bruised apples, which he proudly presented to his parents as his own, claiming to have bartered for them with a cunning deal. His parents were amused by his audacity, but Lennon felt a thrill of accomplishment, a taste of the power that came with persuasion and guile.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart to the neighboring town to sell surplus vegetables from their farm. He charmed the townspeople with his quick wit and charming smile, selling out his entire stock in record time. His father was impressed by his son&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, but Lennon was ecstatic with the attention and praise, convinced he was a natural born salesman.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced a wealthy landowner to invest in a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant port. He promised the landowner a hefty profit, weaving tales of rare and delicious varieties that would fetch a fortune in the market. The landowner, swayed by Lennon&#x27;s charisma and promises, agreed to the deal. The shipment arrived, however, to reveal mostly rotten fruit, a result of Lennon&#x27;s deceptive negotiations and disregard for quality. The landowner was furious, but Lennon managed to weasel his way out of the situation, blaming the supplier and promising to make amends.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he embarked on his first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. He loaded his wagon with the finest fruits he could find, carefully arranging them into a dazzling display. He travelled from town to town, captivating crowds with his stories and charm, selling his wares at inflated prices. He reveled in the attention, the admiration, and the feeling of being the center of attention, convinced he was destined for greatness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He spent hours observing the merchants, mimicking their sales pitches and haggling techniques. He returned home with a handful of bruised apples, which he proudly presented to his parents as his own, claiming to have bartered for them with a cunning deal. His parents were amused by his audacity, but Lennon felt a thrill of accomplishment, a taste of the power that came with persuasion and guile.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart to the neighboring town to sell surplus vegetables from their farm. He charmed the townspeople with his quick wit and charming smile, selling out his entire stock in record time. His father was impressed by his son&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, but Lennon was ecstatic with the attention and praise, convinced he was a natural born salesman.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced a wealthy landowner to invest in a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant port. He promised the landowner a hefty profit, weaving tales of rare and delicious varieties that would fetch a fortune in the market. The landowner, swayed by Lennon&#x27;s charisma and promises, agreed to the deal. The shipment arrived, however, to reveal mostly rotten fruit, a result of Lennon&#x27;s deceptive negotiations and disregard for quality. The landowner was furious, but Lennon managed to weasel his way out of the situation, blaming the supplier and promising to make amends.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he embarked on his first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant.

He reveled in the attention, the admiration, and the feeling of being the center of attention, convinced he was destined for greatness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully carried them inside, convinced he could raise them as his own, and demanded his mother build him a miniature coop. His parents, exhausted from a day in the fields, indulged him, but Lennon was heartbroken when the eggs never hatched. He insisted, however, that he had felt them move, proof of his special connection to the birds.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he convinced the village children to stage a play about a brave knight rescuing a princess from a dragon. He cast himself as the knight, of course, and insisted on elaborate costumes and props, spending hours rehearsing his lines in front of a mirror. The other children were happy to play along, swept up in Lennon&#x27;s infectious enthusiasm, but the performance itself was a chaotic mess. Lennon, however, basked in the applause, convinced of his own theatrical genius.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he snuck into the village market after hours, captivated by the vibrant colours and exotic smells of the fruit stalls. He spent hours observing the merchants, mimicking their sales pitches and haggling techniques. He returned home with a handful of bruised apples, which he proudly presented to his parents as his own, claiming to have bartered for them with a cunning deal. His parents were amused by his audacity, but Lennon felt a thrill of accomplishment, a taste of the power that came with persuasion and guile.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart to the neighboring town to sell surplus vegetables from their farm. He charmed the townspeople with his quick wit and charming smile, selling out his entire stock in record time. His father was impressed by his son&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, but Lennon was ecstatic with the attention and praise, convinced he was a natural born salesman.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced a wealthy landowner to invest in a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant port. He promised the landowner a hefty profit, weaving tales of rare and delicious varieties that would fetch a fortune in the market. The landowner, swayed by Lennon&#x27;s charisma and promises, agreed to the deal. The shipment arrived, however, to reveal mostly rotten fruit, a result of Lennon&#x27;s deceptive negotiations and disregard for quality. The landowner was furious, but Lennon managed to weasel his way out of the situation, blaming the supplier and promising to make amends.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he embarked on his first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. He loaded his wagon with the finest fruits he could find, carefully arranging them into a dazzling display. He travelled from town to town, captivating crowds with his stories and charm, selling his wares at inflated prices. He reveled in the attention, the admiration, and the feeling of being the center of attention, convinced he was destined for greatness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant colours of the silks and spices, the exotic scents of dried fruits and strange herbs, filled Cedric with a longing he couldn&#x27;t name. He knew, with a certainty that surprised even him, that this was what he wanted to do.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, his father took him to the carpentry workshop for the first time. The smell of sawdust and varnish was overwhelming, and the rhythmic thud of hammers against wood made Cedric&#x27;s head ache. He tried his best to follow his father&#x27;s instructions, but his hands were clumsy and uncoordinated. The disappointed look on his father&#x27;s face stung Cedric more than any splinter.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck away from his chores to spend the afternoon at the fruit market. He helped a kind old woman arrange her baskets of apples and pears, carefully selecting the ripest fruit and arranging them in artful displays. For the first time, Cedric felt a sense of accomplishment, a quiet pride in his ability to bring beauty to something as simple as a pile of fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s excess apples at the market. He spent hours polishing each apple, arranging them in neat rows, and calling out to passersby with a voice that trembled with nerves. He sold out by midday, earning a small profit that he proudly presented to his father.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left his father&#x27;s workshop for good, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement. He bought a small wagon and stocked it with baskets of fruit, his meagre savings barely covering the cost. As he set off down the dusty road, he felt a surge of freedom, a sense of finally being in control of his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelling merchants who taught him the art of haggling. He learned to read people, to sense their needs and desires, and to negotiate prices with a confidence he never thought he possessed. He realized that his gentle nature, once a source of insecurity, could be an asset, disarming even the most hardened bargainers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He spent hours observing the merchants, mimicking their sales pitches and haggling techniques. He returned home with a handful of bruised apples, which he proudly presented to his parents as his own, claiming to have bartered for them with a cunning deal. His parents were amused by his audacity, but Lennon felt a thrill of accomplishment, a taste of the power that came with persuasion and guile.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart to the neighboring town to sell surplus vegetables from their farm. He charmed the townspeople with his quick wit and charming smile, selling out his entire stock in record time. His father was impressed by his son&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, but Lennon was ecstatic with the attention and praise, convinced he was a natural born salesman.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced a wealthy landowner to invest in a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant port. He promised the landowner a hefty profit, weaving tales of rare and delicious varieties that would fetch a fortune in the market. The landowner, swayed by Lennon&#x27;s charisma and promises, agreed to the deal. The shipment arrived, however, to reveal mostly rotten fruit, a result of Lennon&#x27;s deceptive negotiations and disregard for quality. The landowner was furious, but Lennon managed to weasel his way out of the situation, blaming the supplier and promising to make amends.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he embarked on his first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. He loaded his wagon with the finest fruits he could find, carefully arranging them into a dazzling display. He travelled from town to town, captivating crowds with his stories and charm, selling his wares at inflated prices. He reveled in the attention, the admiration, and the feeling of being the center of attention, convinced he was destined for greatness.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.
