It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

Tears welled up in his eyes, but he quickly brushed them away, forcing a grin and declaring it &quot;a badge of honor&quot; to anyone who asked. He didn&#x27;t want to appear weak, even though the pain made him want to cry.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell his father&#x27;s prize-winning pumpkin at the village market, hoping to earn some extra coins.  He boasted about its size and sweetness, but no one would buy it because it was oddly shaped. He felt a pang of shame, realizing that charm alone couldn&#x27;t always make up for a less-than-perfect product.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father talking about how disappointed he was in Cedric&#x27;s lack of interest in farming. Cedric felt a surge of anger, vowing to prove his father wrong by becoming successful in his own way. He started spending hours practicing his sales pitch, using his father&#x27;s prized apples as his practice merchandise.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market, promising a higher profit than he could get elsewhere.  He negotiated a deal that seemed too good to be true, but he managed to sell every last piece of fruit, earning a tidy sum.  The experience filled him with a sense of accomplishment and fueled his desire to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he set off on his first solo trip, his rickety cart loaded with fruit from his father&#x27;s farm. He was terrified of failing, but he plastered on a confident smile and charmed his way into the hearts of the villagers, selling out his entire stock. The success, though fleeting, gave him a taste of the life he craved.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut his prices, forcing Cedric to lower his own to compete. He felt a sharp sting of jealousy and insecurity, but he refused to back down, working even harder to attract customers. He realized that success wasn&#x27;t guaranteed and that he had to constantly fight to maintain his position.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della was fascinated by the bird’s tireless work, its dedication to creating a home for its young. But when a storm came and destroyed the nest, Della felt a perverse sense of satisfaction; the world, she thought, was inherently cruel and even the most earnest efforts were ultimately futile.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her father gave her a small plot of land to tend. She planted seeds with begrudging obedience, but the seedlings struggled to grow in the hard-packed soil. Della neglected them, letting the weeds choke out the fragile sprouts; she saw no point in nurturing something that was destined to wither and die.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling salesman charm her mother into buying a set of brightly colored dishes. The salesman was a master of his craft, weaving tales of happiness and prosperity, but Della saw through his facade. The dishes were cheaply made and would soon chip and crack; she knew her mother would be disappointed, yet she said nothing.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father sell their apples at the market. She watched as customers haggled over prices, their faces contorted with greed. Della realized that even the simplest transactions were tainted by selfishness and deception; the world was a marketplace where everyone was trying to get ahead at the expense of others.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of coins. She travelled to the next town and bought a crate of bruised apples at a discount. She then sold them at a markup, pocketing a meager profit. Della felt a thrill of satisfaction; she had outsmarted the system, exploiting the desperation of others for her own gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was caught trying to shortchange a customer. The man, a burly farmer, confronted her, his face red with anger. Della, unfazed, argued back, her voice sharp and cold. She refused to apologize, seeing no reason to feel remorse for her actions.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She planted seeds with begrudging obedience, but the seedlings struggled to grow in the hard-packed soil. Della neglected them, letting the weeds choke out the fragile sprouts; she saw no point in nurturing something that was destined to wither and die.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling salesman charm her mother into buying a set of brightly colored dishes. The salesman was a master of his craft, weaving tales of happiness and prosperity, but Della saw through his facade. The dishes were cheaply made and would soon chip and crack; she knew her mother would be disappointed, yet she said nothing.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father sell their apples at the market. She watched as customers haggled over prices, their faces contorted with greed. Della realized that even the simplest transactions were tainted by selfishness and deception; the world was a marketplace where everyone was trying to get ahead at the expense of others.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of coins. She travelled to the next town and bought a crate of bruised apples at a discount. She then sold them at a markup, pocketing a meager profit. Della felt a thrill of satisfaction; she had outsmarted the system, exploiting the desperation of others for her own gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was caught trying to shortchange a customer. The man, a burly farmer, confronted her, his face red with anger. Della, unfazed, argued back, her voice sharp and cold. She refused to apologize, seeing no reason to feel remorse for her actions.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Tears welled up in his eyes, but he quickly brushed them away, forcing a grin and declaring it &quot;a badge of honor&quot; to anyone who asked. He didn&#x27;t want to appear weak, even though the pain made him want to cry.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell his father&#x27;s prize-winning pumpkin at the village market, hoping to earn some extra coins.  He boasted about its size and sweetness, but no one would buy it because it was oddly shaped. He felt a pang of shame, realizing that charm alone couldn&#x27;t always make up for a less-than-perfect product.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father talking about how disappointed he was in Cedric&#x27;s lack of interest in farming. Cedric felt a surge of anger, vowing to prove his father wrong by becoming successful in his own way. He started spending hours practicing his sales pitch, using his father&#x27;s prized apples as his practice merchandise.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market, promising a higher profit than he could get elsewhere.  He negotiated a deal that seemed too good to be true, but he managed to sell every last piece of fruit, earning a tidy sum.  The experience filled him with a sense of accomplishment and fueled his desire to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he set off on his first solo trip, his rickety cart loaded with fruit from his father&#x27;s farm. He was terrified of failing, but he plastered on a confident smile and charmed his way into the hearts of the villagers, selling out his entire stock. The success, though fleeting, gave him a taste of the life he craved.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut his prices, forcing Cedric to lower his own to compete. He felt a sharp sting of jealousy and insecurity, but he refused to back down, working even harder to attract customers. He realized that success wasn&#x27;t guaranteed and that he had to constantly fight to maintain his position.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Despite the loss, Lennon helped their mother salvage what fruit they could, their small hands carefully picking up bruised but still edible pieces. This early experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and making the most of difficult situations.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they accompanied their mother to the village market to sell their fruit. Watching their mother negotiate with customers, Lennon learned the art of bartering and the power of a smile. It was then that Lennon first felt the thrill of a successful trade and the satisfaction of providing for their family.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild raspberries growing deep in the woods. Recognizing the potential profit, Lennon carefully harvested the berries and sold them at the market, earning more than they ever had before. This experience ignited Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and fueled their desire to explore the world beyond their village.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon persevered, their determination strengthened by the thought of bringing back much-needed income. This trip marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s life as a travelling merchant and solidified their independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob them of their earnings. Though outnumbered and afraid, Lennon stood their ground, using their wit and negotiation skills to talk the bandits down. This experience taught Lennon the importance of courage and the power of words.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced their first major financial setback when a shipment of fruit spoiled on the journey. Devastated but undeterred, Lennon learned from their mistake, investing in better storage methods for future trips. This experience taught Lennon the importance of learning from setbacks and adapting to challenges.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della was fascinated by the bird’s tireless work, its dedication to creating a home for its young. But when a storm came and destroyed the nest, Della felt a perverse sense of satisfaction; the world, she thought, was inherently cruel and even the most earnest efforts were ultimately futile.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her father gave her a small plot of land to tend. She planted seeds with begrudging obedience, but the seedlings struggled to grow in the hard-packed soil. Della neglected them, letting the weeds choke out the fragile sprouts; she saw no point in nurturing something that was destined to wither and die.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling salesman charm her mother into buying a set of brightly colored dishes. The salesman was a master of his craft, weaving tales of happiness and prosperity, but Della saw through his facade. The dishes were cheaply made and would soon chip and crack; she knew her mother would be disappointed, yet she said nothing.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father sell their apples at the market. She watched as customers haggled over prices, their faces contorted with greed. Della realized that even the simplest transactions were tainted by selfishness and deception; the world was a marketplace where everyone was trying to get ahead at the expense of others.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of coins. She travelled to the next town and bought a crate of bruised apples at a discount. She then sold them at a markup, pocketing a meager profit. Della felt a thrill of satisfaction; she had outsmarted the system, exploiting the desperation of others for her own gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was caught trying to shortchange a customer. The man, a burly farmer, confronted her, his face red with anger. Della, unfazed, argued back, her voice sharp and cold. She refused to apologize, seeing no reason to feel remorse for her actions.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Tears welled up in his eyes, but he quickly brushed them away, forcing a grin and declaring it &quot;a badge of honor&quot; to anyone who asked. He didn&#x27;t want to appear weak, even though the pain made him want to cry.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell his father&#x27;s prize-winning pumpkin at the village market, hoping to earn some extra coins.

He didn&#x27;t want to appear weak, even though the pain made him want to cry.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell his father&#x27;s prize-winning pumpkin at the village market, hoping to earn some extra coins.  He boasted about its size and sweetness, but no one would buy it because it was oddly shaped.

He didn&#x27;t want to appear weak, even though the pain made him want to cry.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell his father&#x27;s prize-winning pumpkin at the village market, hoping to earn some extra coins.  He boasted about its size and sweetness, but no one would buy it because it was oddly shaped. He felt a pang of shame, realizing that charm alone couldn&#x27;t always make up for a less-than-perfect product.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father talking about how disappointed he was in Cedric&#x27;s lack of interest in farming.

The success, though fleeting, gave him a taste of the life he craved.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut his prices, forcing Cedric to lower his own to compete.

Despite the loss, Lennon helped their mother salvage what fruit they could, their small hands carefully picking up bruised but still edible pieces. This early experience taught Lennon the importance of resilience and making the most of difficult situations.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they accompanied their mother to the village market to sell their fruit. Watching their mother negotiate with customers, Lennon learned the art of bartering and the power of a smile. It was then that Lennon first felt the thrill of a successful trade and the satisfaction of providing for their family.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild raspberries growing deep in the woods. Recognizing the potential profit, Lennon carefully harvested the berries and sold them at the market, earning more than they ever had before. This experience ignited Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit and fueled their desire to explore the world beyond their village.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon persevered, their determination strengthened by the thought of bringing back much-needed income. This trip marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s life as a travelling merchant and solidified their independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob them of their earnings. Though outnumbered and afraid, Lennon stood their ground, using their wit and negotiation skills to talk the bandits down. This experience taught Lennon the importance of courage and the power of words.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced their first major financial setback when a shipment of fruit spoiled on the journey.

Tears welled up in his eyes, but he quickly brushed them away, forcing a grin and declaring it &quot;a badge of honor&quot; to anyone who asked. He didn&#x27;t want to appear weak, even though the pain made him want to cry.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell his father&#x27;s prize-winning pumpkin at the village market, hoping to earn some extra coins.  He boasted about its size and sweetness, but no one would buy it because it was oddly shaped. He felt a pang of shame, realizing that charm alone couldn&#x27;t always make up for a less-than-perfect product.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father talking about how disappointed he was in Cedric&#x27;s lack of interest in farming. Cedric felt a surge of anger, vowing to prove his father wrong by becoming successful in his own way.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della was fascinated by the bird’s tireless work, its dedication to creating a home for its young. But when a storm came and destroyed the nest, Della felt a perverse sense of satisfaction; the world, she thought, was inherently cruel and even the most earnest efforts were ultimately futile.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, her father gave her a small plot of land to tend. She planted seeds with begrudging obedience, but the seedlings struggled to grow in the hard-packed soil. Della neglected them, letting the weeds choke out the fragile sprouts; she saw no point in nurturing something that was destined to wither and die.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling salesman charm her mother into buying a set of brightly colored dishes. The salesman was a master of his craft, weaving tales of happiness and prosperity, but Della saw through his facade. The dishes were cheaply made and would soon chip and crack; she knew her mother would be disappointed, yet she said nothing.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father sell their apples at the market. She watched as customers haggled over prices, their faces contorted with greed. Della realized that even the simplest transactions were tainted by selfishness and deception; the world was a marketplace where everyone was trying to get ahead at the expense of others.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of coins. She travelled to the next town and bought a crate of bruised apples at a discount. She then sold them at a markup, pocketing a meager profit. Della felt a thrill of satisfaction; she had outsmarted the system, exploiting the desperation of others for her own gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was caught trying to shortchange a customer. The man, a burly farmer, confronted her, his face red with anger. Della, unfazed, argued back, her voice sharp and cold. She refused to apologize, seeing no reason to feel remorse for her actions.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She planted seeds with begrudging obedience, but the seedlings struggled to grow in the hard-packed soil. Della neglected them, letting the weeds choke out the fragile sprouts; she saw no point in nurturing something that was destined to wither and die.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling salesman charm her mother into buying a set of brightly colored dishes. The salesman was a master of his craft, weaving tales of happiness and prosperity, but Della saw through his facade. The dishes were cheaply made and would soon chip and crack; she knew her mother would be disappointed, yet she said nothing.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father sell their apples at the market. She watched as customers haggled over prices, their faces contorted with greed. Della realized that even the simplest transactions were tainted by selfishness and deception; the world was a marketplace where everyone was trying to get ahead at the expense of others.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of coins. She travelled to the next town and bought a crate of bruised apples at a discount. She then sold them at a markup, pocketing a meager profit. Della felt a thrill of satisfaction; she had outsmarted the system, exploiting the desperation of others for her own gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was caught trying to shortchange a customer. The man, a burly farmer, confronted her, his face red with anger. Della, unfazed, argued back, her voice sharp and cold. She refused to apologize, seeing no reason to feel remorse for her actions.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She planted seeds with begrudging obedience, but the seedlings struggled to grow in the hard-packed soil. Della neglected them, letting the weeds choke out the fragile sprouts; she saw no point in nurturing something that was destined to wither and die.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling salesman charm her mother into buying a set of brightly colored dishes. The salesman was a master of his craft, weaving tales of happiness and prosperity, but Della saw through his facade. The dishes were cheaply made and would soon chip and crack; she knew her mother would be disappointed, yet she said nothing.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father sell their apples at the market. She watched as customers haggled over prices, their faces contorted with greed. Della realized that even the simplest transactions were tainted by selfishness and deception; the world was a marketplace where everyone was trying to get ahead at the expense of others.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of coins. She travelled to the next town and bought a crate of bruised apples at a discount. She then sold them at a markup, pocketing a meager profit. Della felt a thrill of satisfaction; she had outsmarted the system, exploiting the desperation of others for her own gain.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was caught trying to shortchange a customer. The man, a burly farmer, confronted her, his face red with anger. Della, unfazed, argued back, her voice sharp and cold. She refused to apologize, seeing no reason to feel remorse for her actions.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Tears welled up in his eyes, but he quickly brushed them away, forcing a grin and declaring it &quot;a badge of honor&quot; to anyone who asked. He didn&#x27;t want to appear weak, even though the pain made him want to cry.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell his father&#x27;s prize-winning pumpkin at the village market, hoping to earn some extra coins.  He boasted about its size and sweetness, but no one would buy it because it was oddly shaped. He felt a pang of shame, realizing that charm alone couldn&#x27;t always make up for a less-than-perfect product.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father talking about how disappointed he was in Cedric&#x27;s lack of interest in farming. Cedric felt a surge of anger, vowing to prove his father wrong by becoming successful in his own way.

Cedric felt a surge of anger, vowing to prove his father wrong by becoming successful in his own way. He started spending hours practicing his sales pitch, using his father&#x27;s prized apples as his practice merchandise.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market, promising a higher profit than he could get elsewhere.

The success, though fleeting, gave him a taste of the life he craved.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a rival fruit seller who undercut his prices, forcing Cedric to lower his own to compete.

He realized that success wasn&#x27;t guaranteed and that he had to constantly fight to maintain his position.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
