It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in Fruitville.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in Fruitville.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

The way his father&#x27;s words seemed to dance around the other merchant, slowly squeezing out a better deal, fascinated Lennon. From that day forward, Lennon began mimicking their father&#x27;s tone and gestures, practicing his own bartering skills on anyone who would listen.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of dried figs in their family&#x27;s storage room.  Lennon, seeing an opportunity, traded a handful of the figs to a neighbor&#x27;s child for a prized toy soldier. The thrill of getting something they desired without spending their own money ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a group of younger children to help them gather wild berries in exchange for a share of the profits. Lennon then sold the berries at the market, earning more than they had ever seen before.  The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they could manipulate others to achieve their own goals.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled with their father to a distant village, where they encountered a merchant selling exotic fruits. Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, convinced their father to invest in a large shipment of the fruit, which they then sold at a significant markup back home. The success of this venture fueled Lennon&#x27;s hunger for wealth and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling from village to village, buying and selling fruit. Lennon honed their skills as a negotiator, learning to read people and exploit their weaknesses. The isolation of the road, however, began to weigh on Lennon, leaving them feeling increasingly disconnected from others.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a risky investment in a shipment of rare citrus fruits, hoping to corner the market. The gamble paid off handsomely, cementing Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd businessman.  But the success came at a cost, as Lennon had to cut corners and betray the trust of some of their suppliers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The way his father&#x27;s words seemed to dance around the other merchant, slowly squeezing out a better deal, fascinated Lennon. From that day forward, Lennon began mimicking their father&#x27;s tone and gestures, practicing his own bartering skills on anyone who would listen.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of dried figs in their family&#x27;s storage room.  Lennon, seeing an opportunity, traded a handful of the figs to a neighbor&#x27;s child for a prized toy soldier. The thrill of getting something they desired without spending their own money ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a group of younger children to help them gather wild berries in exchange for a share of the profits. Lennon then sold the berries at the market, earning more than they had ever seen before.  The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they could manipulate others to achieve their own goals.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled with their father to a distant village, where they encountered a merchant selling exotic fruits. Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, convinced their father to invest in a large shipment of the fruit, which they then sold at a significant markup back home. The success of this venture fueled Lennon&#x27;s hunger for wealth and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling from village to village, buying and selling fruit. Lennon honed their skills as a negotiator, learning to read people and exploit their weaknesses. The isolation of the road, however, began to weigh on Lennon, leaving them feeling increasingly disconnected from others.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a risky investment in a shipment of rare citrus fruits, hoping to corner the market. The gamble paid off handsomely, cementing Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd businessman.  But the success came at a cost, as Lennon had to cut corners and betray the trust of some of their suppliers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of fruit with a single glance, and to navigate the complexities of trade.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she discovered a hidden grove of wild strawberries, their sweetness unlike anything she&#x27;d tasted before. She gathered as many as she could carry and sold them at the market, doubling her usual profits. The success fueled her ambition, and she dreamed of one day owning her own fruit stall.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she took a gamble and invested all her savings in a shipment of exotic mangoes. The risk paid off handsomely, and her stall became the talk of the town. Della reveled in the attention, her confidence soaring with every satisfied customer.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a rival merchant attempted to sabotage her business by spreading rumors about the quality of her fruit. Della fought back with fierce determination, using her wit and charm to win over her customers. The experience solidified her belief that she could overcome any obstacle.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

The way his father&#x27;s words seemed to dance around the other merchant, slowly squeezing out a better deal, fascinated Lennon. From that day forward, Lennon began mimicking their father&#x27;s tone and gestures, practicing his own bartering skills on anyone who would listen.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of dried figs in their family&#x27;s storage room.  Lennon, seeing an opportunity, traded a handful of the figs to a neighbor&#x27;s child for a prized toy soldier. The thrill of getting something they desired without spending their own money ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a group of younger children to help them gather wild berries in exchange for a share of the profits. Lennon then sold the berries at the market, earning more than they had ever seen before.  The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they could manipulate others to achieve their own goals.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled with their father to a distant village, where they encountered a merchant selling exotic fruits. Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, convinced their father to invest in a large shipment of the fruit, which they then sold at a significant markup back home. The success of this venture fueled Lennon&#x27;s hunger for wealth and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling from village to village, buying and selling fruit. Lennon honed their skills as a negotiator, learning to read people and exploit their weaknesses. The isolation of the road, however, began to weigh on Lennon, leaving them feeling increasingly disconnected from others.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a risky investment in a shipment of rare citrus fruits, hoping to corner the market. The gamble paid off handsomely, cementing Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd businessman.  But the success came at a cost, as Lennon had to cut corners and betray the trust of some of their suppliers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The journey was long and arduous, but Della relished the adventure. She learned to haggle with farmers, to judge the ripeness of fruit with a single glance, and to navigate the complexities of trade.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she discovered a hidden grove of wild strawberries, their sweetness unlike anything she&#x27;d tasted before. She gathered as many as she could carry and sold them at the market, doubling her usual profits. The success fueled her ambition, and she dreamed of one day owning her own fruit stall.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she took a gamble and invested all her savings in a shipment of exotic mangoes.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

The way his father&#x27;s words seemed to dance around the other merchant, slowly squeezing out a better deal, fascinated Lennon. From that day forward, Lennon began mimicking their father&#x27;s tone and gestures, practicing his own bartering skills on anyone who would listen.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of dried figs in their family&#x27;s storage room.  Lennon, seeing an opportunity, traded a handful of the figs to a neighbor&#x27;s child for a prized toy soldier. The thrill of getting something they desired without spending their own money ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a group of younger children to help them gather wild berries in exchange for a share of the profits. Lennon then sold the berries at the market, earning more than they had ever seen before.  The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they could manipulate others to achieve their own goals.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled with their father to a distant village, where they encountered a merchant selling exotic fruits. Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, convinced their father to invest in a large shipment of the fruit, which they then sold at a significant markup back home. The success of this venture fueled Lennon&#x27;s hunger for wealth and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling from village to village, buying and selling fruit. Lennon honed their skills as a negotiator, learning to read people and exploit their weaknesses. The isolation of the road, however, began to weigh on Lennon, leaving them feeling increasingly disconnected from others.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a risky investment in a shipment of rare citrus fruits, hoping to corner the market.

But the success came at a cost, as Lennon had to cut corners and betray the trust of some of their suppliers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;They are fine apples, Lennon, but I&#x27;m trying to make a profit when I sell them back home.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in Fruitville.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The way his father&#x27;s words seemed to dance around the other merchant, slowly squeezing out a better deal, fascinated Lennon. From that day forward, Lennon began mimicking their father&#x27;s tone and gestures, practicing his own bartering skills on anyone who would listen.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of dried figs in their family&#x27;s storage room.  Lennon, seeing an opportunity, traded a handful of the figs to a neighbor&#x27;s child for a prized toy soldier. The thrill of getting something they desired without spending their own money ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a group of younger children to help them gather wild berries in exchange for a share of the profits. Lennon then sold the berries at the market, earning more than they had ever seen before.  The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they could manipulate others to achieve their own goals.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled with their father to a distant village, where they encountered a merchant selling exotic fruits. Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, convinced their father to invest in a large shipment of the fruit, which they then sold at a significant markup back home. The success of this venture fueled Lennon&#x27;s hunger for wealth and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling from village to village, buying and selling fruit. Lennon honed their skills as a negotiator, learning to read people and exploit their weaknesses. The isolation of the road, however, began to weigh on Lennon, leaving them feeling increasingly disconnected from others.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a risky investment in a shipment of rare citrus fruits, hoping to corner the market. The gamble paid off handsomely, cementing Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd businessman.  But the success came at a cost, as Lennon had to cut corners and betray the trust of some of their suppliers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The way his father&#x27;s words seemed to dance around the other merchant, slowly squeezing out a better deal, fascinated Lennon. From that day forward, Lennon began mimicking their father&#x27;s tone and gestures, practicing his own bartering skills on anyone who would listen.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of dried figs in their family&#x27;s storage room.  Lennon, seeing an opportunity, traded a handful of the figs to a neighbor&#x27;s child for a prized toy soldier. The thrill of getting something they desired without spending their own money ignited a spark of ambition within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced a group of younger children to help them gather wild berries in exchange for a share of the profits. Lennon then sold the berries at the market, earning more than they had ever seen before.  The experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief that they could manipulate others to achieve their own goals.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they traveled with their father to a distant village, where they encountered a merchant selling exotic fruits. Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, convinced their father to invest in a large shipment of the fruit, which they then sold at a significant markup back home. The success of this venture fueled Lennon&#x27;s hunger for wealth and power.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling from village to village, buying and selling fruit. Lennon honed their skills as a negotiator, learning to read people and exploit their weaknesses. The isolation of the road, however, began to weigh on Lennon, leaving them feeling increasingly disconnected from others.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made a risky investment in a shipment of rare citrus fruits, hoping to corner the market. The gamble paid off handsomely, cementing Lennon&#x27;s reputation as a shrewd businessman.  But the success came at a cost, as Lennon had to cut corners and betray the trust of some of their suppliers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
