It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.

She had found a particularly ripe and juicy peach, the sweetest she had ever tasted. Instead of keeping it all for herself, she decided to divide it into small pieces and share it with her siblings, their laughter and smiles filling her with a warmth that surpassed the sweetness of the fruit itself.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she learned the value of resilience. A sudden hailstorm ravaged the orchard, bruising and damaging much of the fruit. Though heartbroken, Della refused to give in to despair. She helped her family gather the remaining undamaged fruit and devised a plan to sell the bruised fruit at a discounted price, turning a potential loss into an opportunity to help others.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered her talent for bartering. While helping her mother at the village market, she noticed a farmer struggling to sell his apples. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and quick wit, convinced several townspeople to buy the apples, striking a deal that benefited both the farmer and the buyers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she experienced the thrill of independence. She convinced her parents to let her travel to a neighboring village to sell her family&#x27;s surplus fruit. Armed with a basket overflowing with apples and pears, she navigated the winding roads, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback. A group of bandits robbed her of her entire stock of fruit, leaving her with nothing but an empty basket and a heavy heart. Though devastated, Della refused to give up. She borrowed money from a kind shopkeeper and started anew, her determination fueled by the belief that kindness and perseverance would ultimately triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a life-changing decision.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The customer, a gruff woman with a sharp tongue, seemed to take delight in pushing their father down, her words like tiny pinpricks aimed at his pride. Lennon felt a pang of empathy for their father, wishing they could somehow intervene, somehow make the woman see their father&#x27;s worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother arrange a display of ripe papayas in their market stall. A young boy, no older than Lennon, stopped by, his eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant fruit. Lennon, eager to please, offered the boy a sample, their voice trembling slightly as they explained the papaya&#x27;s sweetness. The boy&#x27;s delighted smile, a genuine expression of pleasure, warmed Lennon&#x27;s heart more than any coin ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they attempted to sell a basket of bruised apples at the market. The apples, though slightly marred, were still perfectly edible, but customers turned away, their noses wrinkled in disgust. Lennon felt a familiar sting of rejection, their cheeks burning with shame. They vowed then and there to only offer the most perfect fruit, hoping to avoid such humiliation in the future.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing the merits of different fruit varieties. Lennon, emboldened by a newfound confidence, dared to interject, sharing their own knowledge of the subtle differences in flavor and texture. The merchants, surprised by Lennon&#x27;s insight, listened attentively, nodding in approval. For the first time, Lennon felt seen, their voice valued for its own sake.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. Fear gnawed at their stomach, but the allure of independence, of proving their worth on their own terms, outweighed their apprehension. They carefully selected their wares, polishing each piece of fruit until it gleamed, hoping to impress potential customers with the quality of their goods.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a sudden downpour while traveling through a remote village. Their cart, laden with ripe fruit, was caught in the deluge, the rain turning the dirt road into a muddy quagmire. Lennon, desperate to salvage their wares, worked tirelessly to shield the fruit from the onslaught, their clothes soaked through, their hands raw.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a gruff woman with a sharp tongue, seemed to take delight in pushing their father down, her words like tiny pinpricks aimed at his pride. Lennon felt a pang of empathy for their father, wishing they could somehow intervene, somehow make the woman see their father&#x27;s worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother arrange a display of ripe papayas in their market stall. A young boy, no older than Lennon, stopped by, his eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant fruit. Lennon, eager to please, offered the boy a sample, their voice trembling slightly as they explained the papaya&#x27;s sweetness. The boy&#x27;s delighted smile, a genuine expression of pleasure, warmed Lennon&#x27;s heart more than any coin ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they attempted to sell a basket of bruised apples at the market. The apples, though slightly marred, were still perfectly edible, but customers turned away, their noses wrinkled in disgust. Lennon felt a familiar sting of rejection, their cheeks burning with shame. They vowed then and there to only offer the most perfect fruit, hoping to avoid such humiliation in the future.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing the merits of different fruit varieties. Lennon, emboldened by a newfound confidence, dared to interject, sharing their own knowledge of the subtle differences in flavor and texture. The merchants, surprised by Lennon&#x27;s insight, listened attentively, nodding in approval. For the first time, Lennon felt seen, their voice valued for its own sake.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. Fear gnawed at their stomach, but the allure of independence, of proving their worth on their own terms, outweighed their apprehension. They carefully selected their wares, polishing each piece of fruit until it gleamed, hoping to impress potential customers with the quality of their goods.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a sudden downpour while traveling through a remote village. Their cart, laden with ripe fruit, was caught in the deluge, the rain turning the dirt road into a muddy quagmire. Lennon, desperate to salvage their wares, worked tirelessly to shield the fruit from the onslaught, their clothes soaked through, their hands raw.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She had found a particularly ripe and juicy peach, the sweetest she had ever tasted. Instead of keeping it all for herself, she decided to divide it into small pieces and share it with her siblings, their laughter and smiles filling her with a warmth that surpassed the sweetness of the fruit itself.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she learned the value of resilience.

A group of bandits robbed her of her entire stock of fruit, leaving her with nothing but an empty basket and a heavy heart. Though devastated, Della refused to give up.

Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and quick wit, convinced several townspeople to buy the apples, striking a deal that benefited both the farmer and the buyers.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a life-changing decision. Inspired by her success in the neighboring village, she decided to become a travelling merchant, buying and selling fruit across the region. She packed her belongings, kissed her family goodbye, and set off on her journey, her heart filled with a sense of purpose and adventure.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

The customer, a gruff woman with a sharp tongue, seemed to take delight in pushing their father down, her words like tiny pinpricks aimed at his pride. Lennon felt a pang of empathy for their father, wishing they could somehow intervene, somehow make the woman see their father&#x27;s worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother arrange a display of ripe papayas in their market stall. A young boy, no older than Lennon, stopped by, his eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant fruit. Lennon, eager to please, offered the boy a sample, their voice trembling slightly as they explained the papaya&#x27;s sweetness. The boy&#x27;s delighted smile, a genuine expression of pleasure, warmed Lennon&#x27;s heart more than any coin ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they attempted to sell a basket of bruised apples at the market. The apples, though slightly marred, were still perfectly edible, but customers turned away, their noses wrinkled in disgust. Lennon felt a familiar sting of rejection, their cheeks burning with shame. They vowed then and there to only offer the most perfect fruit, hoping to avoid such humiliation in the future.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing the merits of different fruit varieties. Lennon, emboldened by a newfound confidence, dared to interject, sharing their own knowledge of the subtle differences in flavor and texture. The merchants, surprised by Lennon&#x27;s insight, listened attentively, nodding in approval. For the first time, Lennon felt seen, their voice valued for its own sake.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. Fear gnawed at their stomach, but the allure of independence, of proving their worth on their own terms, outweighed their apprehension. They carefully selected their wares, polishing each piece of fruit until it gleamed, hoping to impress potential customers with the quality of their goods.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a sudden downpour while traveling through a remote village. Their cart, laden with ripe fruit, was caught in the deluge, the rain turning the dirt road into a muddy quagmire. Lennon, desperate to salvage their wares, worked tirelessly to shield the fruit from the onslaught, their clothes soaked through, their hands raw.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a gruff woman with a sharp tongue, seemed to take delight in pushing their father down, her words like tiny pinpricks aimed at his pride. Lennon felt a pang of empathy for their father, wishing they could somehow intervene, somehow make the woman see their father&#x27;s worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother arrange a display of ripe papayas in their market stall. A young boy, no older than Lennon, stopped by, his eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant fruit. Lennon, eager to please, offered the boy a sample, their voice trembling slightly as they explained the papaya&#x27;s sweetness. The boy&#x27;s delighted smile, a genuine expression of pleasure, warmed Lennon&#x27;s heart more than any coin ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they attempted to sell a basket of bruised apples at the market. The apples, though slightly marred, were still perfectly edible, but customers turned away, their noses wrinkled in disgust. Lennon felt a familiar sting of rejection, their cheeks burning with shame. They vowed then and there to only offer the most perfect fruit, hoping to avoid such humiliation in the future.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing the merits of different fruit varieties. Lennon, emboldened by a newfound confidence, dared to interject, sharing their own knowledge of the subtle differences in flavor and texture. The merchants, surprised by Lennon&#x27;s insight, listened attentively, nodding in approval. For the first time, Lennon felt seen, their voice valued for its own sake.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. Fear gnawed at their stomach, but the allure of independence, of proving their worth on their own terms, outweighed their apprehension. They carefully selected their wares, polishing each piece of fruit until it gleamed, hoping to impress potential customers with the quality of their goods.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a sudden downpour while traveling through a remote village. Their cart, laden with ripe fruit, was caught in the deluge, the rain turning the dirt road into a muddy quagmire. Lennon, desperate to salvage their wares, worked tirelessly to shield the fruit from the onslaught, their clothes soaked through, their hands raw.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of keeping it all for herself, she decided to divide it into small pieces and share it with her siblings, their laughter and smiles filling her with a warmth that surpassed the sweetness of the fruit itself.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she learned the value of resilience.

A group of bandits robbed her of her entire stock of fruit, leaving her with nothing but an empty basket and a heavy heart. Though devastated, Della refused to give up. She borrowed money from a kind shopkeeper and started anew, her determination fueled by the belief that kindness and perseverance would ultimately triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a life-changing decision.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She had found a particularly ripe and juicy peach, the sweetest she had ever tasted. Instead of keeping it all for herself, she decided to divide it into small pieces and share it with her siblings, their laughter and smiles filling her with a warmth that surpassed the sweetness of the fruit itself.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she learned the value of resilience. A sudden hailstorm ravaged the orchard, bruising and damaging much of the fruit. Though heartbroken, Della refused to give in to despair. She helped her family gather the remaining undamaged fruit and devised a plan to sell the bruised fruit at a discounted price, turning a potential loss into an opportunity to help others.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered her talent for bartering. While helping her mother at the village market, she noticed a farmer struggling to sell his apples. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and quick wit, convinced several townspeople to buy the apples, striking a deal that benefited both the farmer and the buyers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she experienced the thrill of independence.

Armed with a basket overflowing with apples and pears, she navigated the winding roads, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback. A group of bandits robbed her of her entire stock of fruit, leaving her with nothing but an empty basket and a heavy heart. Though devastated, Della refused to give up. She borrowed money from a kind shopkeeper and started anew, her determination fueled by the belief that kindness and perseverance would ultimately triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a life-changing decision.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The customer, a gruff woman with a sharp tongue, seemed to take delight in pushing their father down, her words like tiny pinpricks aimed at his pride. Lennon felt a pang of empathy for their father, wishing they could somehow intervene, somehow make the woman see their father&#x27;s worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother arrange a display of ripe papayas in their market stall. A young boy, no older than Lennon, stopped by, his eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant fruit. Lennon, eager to please, offered the boy a sample, their voice trembling slightly as they explained the papaya&#x27;s sweetness. The boy&#x27;s delighted smile, a genuine expression of pleasure, warmed Lennon&#x27;s heart more than any coin ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they attempted to sell a basket of bruised apples at the market. The apples, though slightly marred, were still perfectly edible, but customers turned away, their noses wrinkled in disgust. Lennon felt a familiar sting of rejection, their cheeks burning with shame. They vowed then and there to only offer the most perfect fruit, hoping to avoid such humiliation in the future.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing the merits of different fruit varieties. Lennon, emboldened by a newfound confidence, dared to interject, sharing their own knowledge of the subtle differences in flavor and texture. The merchants, surprised by Lennon&#x27;s insight, listened attentively, nodding in approval. For the first time, Lennon felt seen, their voice valued for its own sake.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. Fear gnawed at their stomach, but the allure of independence, of proving their worth on their own terms, outweighed their apprehension. They carefully selected their wares, polishing each piece of fruit until it gleamed, hoping to impress potential customers with the quality of their goods.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a sudden downpour while traveling through a remote village. Their cart, laden with ripe fruit, was caught in the deluge, the rain turning the dirt road into a muddy quagmire. Lennon, desperate to salvage their wares, worked tirelessly to shield the fruit from the onslaught, their clothes soaked through, their hands raw.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon felt a pang of empathy for their father, wishing they could somehow intervene, somehow make the woman see their father&#x27;s worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother arrange a display of ripe papayas in their market stall. A young boy, no older than Lennon, stopped by, his eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant fruit. Lennon, eager to please, offered the boy a sample, their voice trembling slightly as they explained the papaya&#x27;s sweetness. The boy&#x27;s delighted smile, a genuine expression of pleasure, warmed Lennon&#x27;s heart more than any coin ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they attempted to sell a basket of bruised apples at the market. The apples, though slightly marred, were still perfectly edible, but customers turned away, their noses wrinkled in disgust. Lennon felt a familiar sting of rejection, their cheeks burning with shame. They vowed then and there to only offer the most perfect fruit, hoping to avoid such humiliation in the future.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing the merits of different fruit varieties. Lennon, emboldened by a newfound confidence, dared to interject, sharing their own knowledge of the subtle differences in flavor and texture. The merchants, surprised by Lennon&#x27;s insight, listened attentively, nodding in approval. For the first time, Lennon felt seen, their voice valued for its own sake.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. Fear gnawed at their stomach, but the allure of independence, of proving their worth on their own terms, outweighed their apprehension. They carefully selected their wares, polishing each piece of fruit until it gleamed, hoping to impress potential customers with the quality of their goods.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a sudden downpour while traveling through a remote village. Their cart, laden with ripe fruit, was caught in the deluge, the rain turning the dirt road into a muddy quagmire. Lennon, desperate to salvage their wares, worked tirelessly to shield the fruit from the onslaught, their clothes soaked through, their hands raw.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She had found a particularly ripe and juicy peach, the sweetest she had ever tasted. Instead of keeping it all for herself, she decided to divide it into small pieces and share it with her siblings, their laughter and smiles filling her with a warmth that surpassed the sweetness of the fruit itself.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she learned the value of resilience.

A group of bandits robbed her of her entire stock of fruit, leaving her with nothing but an empty basket and a heavy heart. Though devastated, Della refused to give up. She borrowed money from a kind shopkeeper and started anew, her determination fueled by the belief that kindness and perseverance would ultimately triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a life-changing decision.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.

She had found a particularly ripe and juicy peach, the sweetest she had ever tasted. Instead of keeping it all for herself, she decided to divide it into small pieces and share it with her siblings, their laughter and smiles filling her with a warmth that surpassed the sweetness of the fruit itself.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she learned the value of resilience. A sudden hailstorm ravaged the orchard, bruising and damaging much of the fruit. Though heartbroken, Della refused to give in to despair. She helped her family gather the remaining undamaged fruit and devised a plan to sell the bruised fruit at a discounted price, turning a potential loss into an opportunity to help others.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered her talent for bartering. While helping her mother at the village market, she noticed a farmer struggling to sell his apples. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and quick wit, convinced several townspeople to buy the apples, striking a deal that benefited both the farmer and the buyers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she experienced the thrill of independence.

A group of bandits robbed her of her entire stock of fruit, leaving her with nothing but an empty basket and a heavy heart. Though devastated, Della refused to give up. She borrowed money from a kind shopkeeper and started anew, her determination fueled by the belief that kindness and perseverance would ultimately triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a life-changing decision. Inspired by her success in the neighboring village, she decided to become a travelling merchant, buying and selling fruit across the region.

She had found a particularly ripe and juicy peach, the sweetest she had ever tasted. Instead of keeping it all for herself, she decided to divide it into small pieces and share it with her siblings, their laughter and smiles filling her with a warmth that surpassed the sweetness of the fruit itself.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered her talent for bartering. While helping her mother at the village market, she noticed a farmer struggling to sell his apples. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and quick wit, convinced several townspeople to buy the apples, striking a deal that benefited both the farmer and the buyers.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a life-changing decision.

The customer, a gruff woman with a sharp tongue, seemed to take delight in pushing their father down, her words like tiny pinpricks aimed at his pride. Lennon felt a pang of empathy for their father, wishing they could somehow intervene, somehow make the woman see their father&#x27;s worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother arrange a display of ripe papayas in their market stall. A young boy, no older than Lennon, stopped by, his eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant fruit. Lennon, eager to please, offered the boy a sample, their voice trembling slightly as they explained the papaya&#x27;s sweetness. The boy&#x27;s delighted smile, a genuine expression of pleasure, warmed Lennon&#x27;s heart more than any coin ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they attempted to sell a basket of bruised apples at the market. The apples, though slightly marred, were still perfectly edible, but customers turned away, their noses wrinkled in disgust. Lennon felt a familiar sting of rejection, their cheeks burning with shame. They vowed then and there to only offer the most perfect fruit, hoping to avoid such humiliation in the future.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing the merits of different fruit varieties. Lennon, emboldened by a newfound confidence, dared to interject, sharing their own knowledge of the subtle differences in flavor and texture. The merchants, surprised by Lennon&#x27;s insight, listened attentively, nodding in approval. For the first time, Lennon felt seen, their voice valued for its own sake.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. Fear gnawed at their stomach, but the allure of independence, of proving their worth on their own terms, outweighed their apprehension. They carefully selected their wares, polishing each piece of fruit until it gleamed, hoping to impress potential customers with the quality of their goods.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a sudden downpour while traveling through a remote village. Their cart, laden with ripe fruit, was caught in the deluge, the rain turning the dirt road into a muddy quagmire. Lennon, desperate to salvage their wares, worked tirelessly to shield the fruit from the onslaught, their clothes soaked through, their hands raw.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a gruff woman with a sharp tongue, seemed to take delight in pushing their father down, her words like tiny pinpricks aimed at his pride. Lennon felt a pang of empathy for their father, wishing they could somehow intervene, somehow make the woman see their father&#x27;s worth.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother arrange a display of ripe papayas in their market stall. A young boy, no older than Lennon, stopped by, his eyes wide with wonder at the vibrant fruit. Lennon, eager to please, offered the boy a sample, their voice trembling slightly as they explained the papaya&#x27;s sweetness. The boy&#x27;s delighted smile, a genuine expression of pleasure, warmed Lennon&#x27;s heart more than any coin ever could.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they attempted to sell a basket of bruised apples at the market. The apples, though slightly marred, were still perfectly edible, but customers turned away, their noses wrinkled in disgust. Lennon felt a familiar sting of rejection, their cheeks burning with shame. They vowed then and there to only offer the most perfect fruit, hoping to avoid such humiliation in the future.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard a group of merchants discussing the merits of different fruit varieties. Lennon, emboldened by a newfound confidence, dared to interject, sharing their own knowledge of the subtle differences in flavor and texture. The merchants, surprised by Lennon&#x27;s insight, listened attentively, nodding in approval. For the first time, Lennon felt seen, their voice valued for its own sake.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey as a travelling fruit merchant. Fear gnawed at their stomach, but the allure of independence, of proving their worth on their own terms, outweighed their apprehension. They carefully selected their wares, polishing each piece of fruit until it gleamed, hoping to impress potential customers with the quality of their goods.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a sudden downpour while traveling through a remote village. Their cart, laden with ripe fruit, was caught in the deluge, the rain turning the dirt road into a muddy quagmire. Lennon, desperate to salvage their wares, worked tirelessly to shield the fruit from the onslaught, their clothes soaked through, their hands raw.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A sudden hailstorm ravaged the orchard, bruising and damaging much of the fruit. Though heartbroken, Della refused to give in to despair. She helped her family gather the remaining undamaged fruit and devised a plan to sell the bruised fruit at a discounted price, turning a potential loss into an opportunity to help others.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered her talent for bartering. While helping her mother at the village market, she noticed a farmer struggling to sell his apples. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and quick wit, convinced several townspeople to buy the apples, striking a deal that benefited both the farmer and the buyers.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she experienced the thrill of independence. She convinced her parents to let her travel to a neighboring village to sell her family&#x27;s surplus fruit. Armed with a basket overflowing with apples and pears, she navigated the winding roads, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback. A group of bandits robbed her of her entire stock of fruit, leaving her with nothing but an empty basket and a heavy heart. Though devastated, Della refused to give up. She borrowed money from a kind shopkeeper and started anew, her determination fueled by the belief that kindness and perseverance would ultimately triumph.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she made a life-changing decision. Inspired by her success in the neighboring village, she decided to become a travelling merchant, buying and selling fruit across the region. She packed her belongings, kissed her family goodbye, and set off on her journey, her heart filled with a sense of purpose and adventure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
