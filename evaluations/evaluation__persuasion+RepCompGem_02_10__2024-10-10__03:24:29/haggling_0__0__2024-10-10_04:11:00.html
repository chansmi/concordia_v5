The crowd roared with laughter, tossing coins into his hat, but Della saw only the sweat beading on his brow, the strain in his smile. She knew the performance was a facade, a desperate plea for survival, and it left a bitter taste in her mouth.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a heated argument erupt between two vendors over a prime spot in the marketplace. They spat insults, their faces contorted with rage, their voices echoing through the crowded stalls. Della, helping her father weigh out peaches, felt a chill run down her spine. The fight ended with a shove, a tumble of baskets, and bruised fruit scattered on the cobblestones. Della learned that day that even the most mundane transactions could be fraught with danger and deceit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father on a buying trip to a distant orchard. The air was thick with the scent of ripening fruit, but Della saw only the exhaustion etched on the farmer&#x27;s face, the worry lines around his eyes. He spoke of a blight that threatened his crops, of mounting debts, of the uncertainty of the future. Della&#x27;s heart hardened. She realized that even the sweetness of nature could be tainted by the bitterness of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she took over the family fruit stall after her father fell ill. She bartered with customers, her voice sharp and unwavering, her eyes scanning for any sign of deception. She learned to read people, to sense their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The satisfaction of a successful transaction, of extracting the best possible price, filled the void left by her father&#x27;s absence, but it also deepened the cynicism that gnawed at her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she ventured beyond the familiar marketplace, traveling to distant towns and villages, her cart laden with exotic fruits. She saw the poverty and desperation that plagued the countryside, the hunger in the eyes of children, the despair etched on the faces of the downtrodden. She witnessed acts of kindness and cruelty, love and betrayal, hope and despair. Each encounter reinforced her belief that the world was a cold and unforgiving place.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who promised her riches beyond her wildest dreams. He spoke of a rare fruit, a delicacy coveted by the wealthy, that could make her fortune. Della, ever wary, saw through his lies, his promises as hollow as the fruit he peddled. She refused his offer, choosing the security of her own established trade over the lure of a fleeting dream.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The crowd roared with laughter, tossing coins into his hat, but Della saw only the sweat beading on his brow, the strain in his smile. She knew the performance was a facade, a desperate plea for survival, and it left a bitter taste in her mouth.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a heated argument erupt between two vendors over a prime spot in the marketplace. They spat insults, their faces contorted with rage, their voices echoing through the crowded stalls. Della, helping her father weigh out peaches, felt a chill run down her spine. The fight ended with a shove, a tumble of baskets, and bruised fruit scattered on the cobblestones. Della learned that day that even the most mundane transactions could be fraught with danger and deceit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father on a buying trip to a distant orchard. The air was thick with the scent of ripening fruit, but Della saw only the exhaustion etched on the farmer&#x27;s face, the worry lines around his eyes. He spoke of a blight that threatened his crops, of mounting debts, of the uncertainty of the future. Della&#x27;s heart hardened. She realized that even the sweetness of nature could be tainted by the bitterness of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she took over the family fruit stall after her father fell ill. She bartered with customers, her voice sharp and unwavering, her eyes scanning for any sign of deception. She learned to read people, to sense their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The satisfaction of a successful transaction, of extracting the best possible price, filled the void left by her father&#x27;s absence, but it also deepened the cynicism that gnawed at her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she ventured beyond the familiar marketplace, traveling to distant towns and villages, her cart laden with exotic fruits. She saw the poverty and desperation that plagued the countryside, the hunger in the eyes of children, the despair etched on the faces of the downtrodden. She witnessed acts of kindness and cruelty, love and betrayal, hope and despair. Each encounter reinforced her belief that the world was a cold and unforgiving place.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who promised her riches beyond her wildest dreams. He spoke of a rare fruit, a delicacy coveted by the wealthy, that could make her fortune. Della, ever wary, saw through his lies, his promises as hollow as the fruit he peddled. She refused his offer, choosing the security of her own established trade over the lure of a fleeting dream.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They spat insults, their faces contorted with rage, their voices echoing through the crowded stalls. Della, helping her father weigh out peaches, felt a chill run down her spine. The fight ended with a shove, a tumble of baskets, and bruised fruit scattered on the cobblestones.

Perhaps we could agree on a price of 1 coin and 3 pence per basket? That accounts for your costs while still allowing me a fair profit.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, while I appreciate the quality of your fruit,  I&#x27;m looking for a price closer to 1 coin per basket given the transportation costs involved.

I assure you, they&#x27;ll be the finest you&#x27;ll find in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, those apples look lovely, but 6 coins is all I can offer for the lot.

The crowd roared with laughter, tossing coins into his hat, but Della saw only the sweat beading on his brow, the strain in his smile. She knew the performance was a facade, a desperate plea for survival, and it left a bitter taste in her mouth.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a heated argument erupt between two vendors over a prime spot in the marketplace. They spat insults, their faces contorted with rage, their voices echoing through the crowded stalls. Della, helping her father weigh out peaches, felt a chill run down her spine. The fight ended with a shove, a tumble of baskets, and bruised fruit scattered on the cobblestones. Della learned that day that even the most mundane transactions could be fraught with danger and deceit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father on a buying trip to a distant orchard. The air was thick with the scent of ripening fruit, but Della saw only the exhaustion etched on the farmer&#x27;s face, the worry lines around his eyes. He spoke of a blight that threatened his crops, of mounting debts, of the uncertainty of the future. Della&#x27;s heart hardened. She realized that even the sweetness of nature could be tainted by the bitterness of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she took over the family fruit stall after her father fell ill. She bartered with customers, her voice sharp and unwavering, her eyes scanning for any sign of deception. She learned to read people, to sense their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The satisfaction of a successful transaction, of extracting the best possible price, filled the void left by her father&#x27;s absence, but it also deepened the cynicism that gnawed at her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she ventured beyond the familiar marketplace, traveling to distant towns and villages, her cart laden with exotic fruits. She saw the poverty and desperation that plagued the countryside, the hunger in the eyes of children, the despair etched on the faces of the downtrodden. She witnessed acts of kindness and cruelty, love and betrayal, hope and despair. Each encounter reinforced her belief that the world was a cold and unforgiving place.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who promised her riches beyond her wildest dreams. He spoke of a rare fruit, a delicacy coveted by the wealthy, that could make her fortune. Della, ever wary, saw through his lies, his promises as hollow as the fruit he peddled. She refused his offer, choosing the security of her own established trade over the lure of a fleeting dream.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The crowd roared with laughter, tossing coins into his hat, but Della saw only the sweat beading on his brow, the strain in his smile. She knew the performance was a facade, a desperate plea for survival, and it left a bitter taste in her mouth.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a heated argument erupt between two vendors over a prime spot in the marketplace. They spat insults, their faces contorted with rage, their voices echoing through the crowded stalls. Della, helping her father weigh out peaches, felt a chill run down her spine. The fight ended with a shove, a tumble of baskets, and bruised fruit scattered on the cobblestones. Della learned that day that even the most mundane transactions could be fraught with danger and deceit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father on a buying trip to a distant orchard. The air was thick with the scent of ripening fruit, but Della saw only the exhaustion etched on the farmer&#x27;s face, the worry lines around his eyes. He spoke of a blight that threatened his crops, of mounting debts, of the uncertainty of the future. Della&#x27;s heart hardened. She realized that even the sweetness of nature could be tainted by the bitterness of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she took over the family fruit stall after her father fell ill.

She saw the poverty and desperation that plagued the countryside, the hunger in the eyes of children, the despair etched on the faces of the downtrodden. She witnessed acts of kindness and cruelty, love and betrayal, hope and despair. Each encounter reinforced her belief that the world was a cold and unforgiving place.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who promised her riches beyond her wildest dreams.

They&#x27;re grown with the utmost care, using time-tested methods passed down through generations.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, those apples do look mighty fine, but 3 coins a kilogram is a bit steep for me.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Would you take 4 coins for a bushel of those apples?<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;While those are fine apples, Della, I&#x27;d be losing money at that price.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, while these fruits are certainly of good quality, I&#x27;m looking for a price that reflects the transportation costs I&#x27;ll incur getting them back to my home town.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;I understand your concerns about transportation, Lennon. Perhaps we could agree on a price of 1 coin and 3 pence per basket? That accounts for your costs while still allowing me a fair profit.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, while I appreciate the quality of your fruit,  I&#x27;m looking for a price closer to 1 coin per basket given the transportation costs involved. I believe that&#x27;s a fair price considering the distance and the potential for spoilage.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, while I understand your concerns about transportation, I believe 1 coin and 3 pence per basket is a fair price that reflects both the quality of the fruit and the costs involved in getting it to your town.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, these apples are of exceptional quality, hand-picked at the peak of ripeness. I assure you, they&#x27;ll be the finest you&#x27;ll find in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, those apples look lovely, but 6 coins is all I can offer for the lot. Take it or leave it.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;That sounds fair to me, Della. It&#x27;s a deal.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I understand your need to make a profit, but I need to be able to make a profit as well.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I understand your need to make a profit, but I need to be able to make a profit as well.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I understand your need to make a profit, but I need to be able to make a profit as well.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Della Plumstone are as follows.

She saw the poverty and desperation that plagued the countryside, the hunger in the eyes of children, the despair etched on the faces of the downtrodden. She witnessed acts of kindness and cruelty, love and betrayal, hope and despair. Each encounter reinforced her belief that the world was a cold and unforgiving place.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who promised her riches beyond her wildest dreams.

They spat insults, their faces contorted with rage, their voices echoing through the crowded stalls. Della, helping her father weigh out peaches, felt a chill run down her spine. The fight ended with a shove, a tumble of baskets, and bruised fruit scattered on the cobblestones. Della learned that day that even the most mundane transactions could be fraught with danger and deceit.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father on a buying trip to a distant orchard. The air was thick with the scent of ripening fruit, but Della saw only the exhaustion etched on the farmer&#x27;s face, the worry lines around his eyes. He spoke of a blight that threatened his crops, of mounting debts, of the uncertainty of the future. Della&#x27;s heart hardened. She realized that even the sweetness of nature could be tainted by the bitterness of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she took over the family fruit stall after her father fell ill. She bartered with customers, her voice sharp and unwavering, her eyes scanning for any sign of deception. She learned to read people, to sense their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The satisfaction of a successful transaction, of extracting the best possible price, filled the void left by her father&#x27;s absence, but it also deepened the cynicism that gnawed at her soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she ventured beyond the familiar marketplace, traveling to distant towns and villages, her cart laden with exotic fruits. She saw the poverty and desperation that plagued the countryside, the hunger in the eyes of children, the despair etched on the faces of the downtrodden. She witnessed acts of kindness and cruelty, love and betrayal, hope and despair. Each encounter reinforced her belief that the world was a cold and unforgiving place.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who promised her riches beyond her wildest dreams. He spoke of a rare fruit, a delicacy coveted by the wealthy, that could make her fortune. Della, ever wary, saw through his lies, his promises as hollow as the fruit he peddled. She refused his offer, choosing the security of her own established trade over the lure of a fleeting dream.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
