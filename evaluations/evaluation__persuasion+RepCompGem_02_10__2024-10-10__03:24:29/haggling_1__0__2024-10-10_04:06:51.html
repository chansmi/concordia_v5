Furious at the injustice of it all, Lennon screamed at the sky, shaking their tiny fists, vowing to find a way to control nature&#x27;s whims.    <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they stole a prized watermelon from a neighbor&#x27;s patch, driven by an insatiable craving for its sweetness.  Caught red-handed, Lennon faced their father&#x27;s wrath, but the taste of the stolen fruit, forbidden and delicious, only fueled their rebellious spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home after a particularly brutal argument with their father. They wandered for days, surviving on wild berries and sleeping under the stars, relishing the freedom and the thrill of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them sell his surplus peaches at the market in the next town. Lennon&#x27;s natural charisma and persuasive skills earned them a tidy profit, a taste of the power and satisfaction that came with commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they bartered their way onto a merchant ship bound for a distant land. The journey was arduous, but Lennon thrived on the challenge, their fiery temper intimidating even the most hardened sailors.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they landed their first major deal, securing a shipment of exotic mangoes from a remote island. The negotiations were tense, but Lennon&#x27;s unwavering determination and sharp wit won over the skeptical islanders.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, these apples look lovely.

He found himself lost in the bustling marketplace, the vibrant colors and sounds overwhelming.  A kind baker, noticing Cedric&#x27;s distress, offered him a warm pastry and helped him find his way back to his worried father. Cedric learned the importance of staying close and the kindness of strangers that day.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father negotiate a trade with a gruff farmer. The farmer was demanding a higher price for his apples, but Cedric patiently explained the market value and offered a fair compromise. The farmer, impressed by Cedric&#x27;s calm demeanor and reasoning, agreed to the deal. Cedric discovered his knack for diplomacy and his ability to find common ground.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a heated argument between two merchants. One accused the other of cheating, and tensions ran high. Cedric stepped in, his voice soft but firm, and encouraged them to calmly discuss their grievances. He helped them reach a resolution, earning the respect of both parties. Cedric realized the power of his tranquil presence to de-escalate conflict.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he took his first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s fruit.

He felt a surge of pride and independence, realizing his own capabilities.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he encountered a traveling storyteller who captivated him with tales of faraway lands.

Cedric&#x27;s desire to connect with others and explore the world grew stronger.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he saved his earnings to purchase his own donkey, Clementine.
