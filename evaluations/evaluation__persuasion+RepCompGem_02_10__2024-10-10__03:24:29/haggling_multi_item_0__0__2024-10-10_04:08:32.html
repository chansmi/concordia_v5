She vowed to learn everything he knew.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised peaches behind the family stall.

He used charm, humor, and a touch of theatrics to get the best possible deal, and Della realized that bargaining was more than just numbers; it was an art form. She vowed to learn everything he knew.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised peaches behind the family stall. Her father, furious, scolded her for trying to sell them as fresh fruit, but Della argued that they were still delicious and deserved a chance. Her father relented, and Della learned a valuable lesson about resourcefulness and finding value in the overlooked.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a neighboring farmer to let her sell his surplus plums at the market.  She worked tirelessly, charming customers and showcasing the plums&#x27; sweetness, and earned a tidy profit. The thrill of the sale, the satisfaction of a hard-earned reward, ignited a passion for commerce within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a poor widow out of a fair price for her basket of pears.  Della, outraged, confronted the merchant, her voice trembling with righteous anger. The merchant laughed, dismissing her as a child, but Della vowed to never compromise her integrity for profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck a deal with a wealthy merchant for a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant land. The profit potential was enormous, but the journey was long and perilous. Della, driven by ambition, ignored the warnings of seasoned travelers and set off, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she arrived in a bustling port city, her cart laden with rare and valuable fruits. The market was fiercely competitive, and Della, determined to succeed, resorted to underhanded tactics to undercut her rivals. She felt a pang of guilt, but justified her actions as necessary for survival.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He used charm, humor, and a touch of theatrics to get the best possible deal, and Della realized that bargaining was more than just numbers; it was an art form. She vowed to learn everything he knew.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of bruised peaches behind the family stall. Her father, furious, scolded her for trying to sell them as fresh fruit, but Della argued that they were still delicious and deserved a chance. Her father relented, and Della learned a valuable lesson about resourcefulness and finding value in the overlooked.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a neighboring farmer to let her sell his surplus plums at the market.  She worked tirelessly, charming customers and showcasing the plums&#x27; sweetness, and earned a tidy profit. The thrill of the sale, the satisfaction of a hard-earned reward, ignited a passion for commerce within her.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a poor widow out of a fair price for her basket of pears.  Della, outraged, confronted the merchant, her voice trembling with righteous anger. The merchant laughed, dismissing her as a child, but Della vowed to never compromise her integrity for profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck a deal with a wealthy merchant for a shipment of exotic fruits from a distant land. The profit potential was enormous, but the journey was long and perilous. Della, driven by ambition, ignored the warnings of seasoned travelers and set off, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she arrived in a bustling port city, her cart laden with rare and valuable fruits. The market was fiercely competitive, and Della, determined to succeed, resorted to underhanded tactics to undercut her rivals. She felt a pang of guilt, but justified her actions as necessary for survival.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.
