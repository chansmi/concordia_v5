You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples are the finest in Fruitville, crisp and juicy.

He copied the blacksmith&#x27;s gruff voice, his heavy footsteps, even the way he wiped sweat from his brow with a soot-stained rag. For a brief moment, Lennon felt a sense of belonging, as if he had finally found his place in the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling storyteller captivating a crowd with tales of faraway lands.

He learned the intricacies of the fruit trade, from identifying ripe produce to haggling with customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they experienced heartbreak for the first time. He had fallen in love with a young woman who appreciated his charm and wit, but when she discovered his tendency to change his personality to please others, she left him. Lennon was devastated, realizing the emptiness of his chameleon-like existence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they decided to become a travelling merchant, buying and selling fruit across the land.

She refused to eat, declaring the pear &quot;utterly beneath her&quot; and demanding a more suitable fruit for someone of her stature.  Her parents, desperate to appease their demanding daughter, eventually relented and brought her a plate piled high with the reddest, juiciest apples.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced the local children to help her build a &quot;royal carriage&quot; out of discarded crates and blankets.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
