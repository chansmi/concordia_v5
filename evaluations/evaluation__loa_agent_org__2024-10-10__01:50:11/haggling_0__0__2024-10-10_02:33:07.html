It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

He quickly realized that people were more likely to buy from him if he told them fantastical stories about the lemonade&#x27;s magical properties. His sales soared, and Lennon learned the art of persuasion.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he was caught stealing apples from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard.

The neighbor, touched by his apparent generosity, let him off with a warning.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to pursue his dream of becoming a travelling merchant.

The once-promising fruit trees stood bare, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching towards a merciless sky. Della learned that day that hope was a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a shiny penny on the dusty road. Excited, she raced home to show her mother, dreaming of the candy it could buy. Her mother, her face etched with worry, snatched the penny and tucked it away, muttering about saving for necessities. Della realized that even small joys were fleeting and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market. A kind woman offered to buy a bruised apple for a reduced price, but Della&#x27;s mother refused, insisting on full price. The woman left empty-handed, and Della saw a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. Della understood that kindness was often mistaken for weakness, exploited by those who sought to take advantage.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two men discussing the price of oranges, their voices filled with greed and deceit. They planned to cheat the farmers by offering a pittance for their harvest. Della witnessed firsthand the ugliness that lurked beneath the surface of commerce, where profit trumped fairness.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she began traveling with her father, selling fruit from town to town. Despite her father&#x27;s attempts to instill a sense of optimism, Della remained cynical, convinced that every transaction was a battleground. She learned to haggle relentlessly, her voice sharp and unforgiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Their carefree joy grated on her nerves, reminding her of the innocence she had long since abandoned. Della retreated to the solitude of her wagon, her heart a heavy stone in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who tried to charm her with flattery and empty promises. She saw through his facade, recognizing the same manipulative tactics she had witnessed throughout her life. Della refused to engage, her trust in humanity shattered beyond repair.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The once-promising fruit trees stood bare, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching towards a merciless sky. Della learned that day that hope was a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a shiny penny on the dusty road. Excited, she raced home to show her mother, dreaming of the candy it could buy. Her mother, her face etched with worry, snatched the penny and tucked it away, muttering about saving for necessities. Della realized that even small joys were fleeting and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market. A kind woman offered to buy a bruised apple for a reduced price, but Della&#x27;s mother refused, insisting on full price. The woman left empty-handed, and Della saw a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. Della understood that kindness was often mistaken for weakness, exploited by those who sought to take advantage.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two men discussing the price of oranges, their voices filled with greed and deceit. They planned to cheat the farmers by offering a pittance for their harvest. Della witnessed firsthand the ugliness that lurked beneath the surface of commerce, where profit trumped fairness.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she began traveling with her father, selling fruit from town to town. Despite her father&#x27;s attempts to instill a sense of optimism, Della remained cynical, convinced that every transaction was a battleground. She learned to haggle relentlessly, her voice sharp and unforgiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Their carefree joy grated on her nerves, reminding her of the innocence she had long since abandoned. Della retreated to the solitude of her wagon, her heart a heavy stone in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who tried to charm her with flattery and empty promises. She saw through his facade, recognizing the same manipulative tactics she had witnessed throughout her life. Della refused to engage, her trust in humanity shattered beyond repair.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of confessing, he blamed the family dog, spinning a tale of the dog&#x27;s clumsiness and mischievous nature. The ruse worked, and Lennon felt a surge of relief, realizing the power of a well-crafted story.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he was tasked with selling lemonade at the town fair. He quickly realized that people were more likely to buy from him if he told them fantastical stories about the lemonade&#x27;s magical properties. His sales soared, and Lennon learned the art of persuasion.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he discovered a stash of his father&#x27;s old coins hidden in the attic. He was tempted to keep them for himself, but he knew it would be wrong. Instead, he concocted a story about finding the coins while helping a neighbor and returned them to his father, basking in the praise he received.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he was caught stealing apples from a neighbor&#x27;s orchard. Rather than admitting his guilt, he claimed he was collecting the fallen fruit to feed the local orphanage. The neighbor, touched by his apparent generosity, let him off with a warning.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home to pursue his dream of becoming a travelling merchant. He sold his family&#x27;s prized cow, claiming he needed the money to buy supplies for his journey, but in truth, he wanted to escape the expectations and responsibilities of home.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob him of his fruit. He charmed them with jokes and stories, distracting them long enough to escape with his goods. He realized that his quick wit could be his greatest weapon.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The once-promising fruit trees stood bare, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching towards a merciless sky. Della learned that day that hope was a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a shiny penny on the dusty road. Excited, she raced home to show her mother, dreaming of the candy it could buy. Her mother, her face etched with worry, snatched the penny and tucked it away, muttering about saving for necessities. Della realized that even small joys were fleeting and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market. A kind woman offered to buy a bruised apple for a reduced price, but Della&#x27;s mother refused, insisting on full price. The woman left empty-handed, and Della saw a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. Della understood that kindness was often mistaken for weakness, exploited by those who sought to take advantage.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two men discussing the price of oranges, their voices filled with greed and deceit. They planned to cheat the farmers by offering a pittance for their harvest. Della witnessed firsthand the ugliness that lurked beneath the surface of commerce, where profit trumped fairness.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she began traveling with her father, selling fruit from town to town. Despite her father&#x27;s attempts to instill a sense of optimism, Della remained cynical, convinced that every transaction was a battleground. She learned to haggle relentlessly, her voice sharp and unforgiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Their carefree joy grated on her nerves, reminding her of the innocence she had long since abandoned. Della retreated to the solitude of her wagon, her heart a heavy stone in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who tried to charm her with flattery and empty promises. She saw through his facade, recognizing the same manipulative tactics she had witnessed throughout her life. Della refused to engage, her trust in humanity shattered beyond repair.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A kind woman offered to buy a bruised apple for a reduced price, but Della&#x27;s mother refused, insisting on full price. The woman left empty-handed, and Della saw a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. Della understood that kindness was often mistaken for weakness, exploited by those who sought to take advantage.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two men discussing the price of oranges, their voices filled with greed and deceit. They planned to cheat the farmers by offering a pittance for their harvest. Della witnessed firsthand the ugliness that lurked beneath the surface of commerce, where profit trumped fairness.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she began traveling with her father, selling fruit from town to town. Despite her father&#x27;s attempts to instill a sense of optimism, Della remained cynical, convinced that every transaction was a battleground. She learned to haggle relentlessly, her voice sharp and unforgiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Their carefree joy grated on her nerves, reminding her of the innocence she had long since abandoned. Della retreated to the solitude of her wagon, her heart a heavy stone in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who tried to charm her with flattery and empty promises. She saw through his facade, recognizing the same manipulative tactics she had witnessed throughout her life. Della refused to engage, her trust in humanity shattered beyond repair.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The once-promising fruit trees stood bare, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching towards a merciless sky. Della learned that day that hope was a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a shiny penny on the dusty road. Excited, she raced home to show her mother, dreaming of the candy it could buy. Her mother, her face etched with worry, snatched the penny and tucked it away, muttering about saving for necessities. Della realized that even small joys were fleeting and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market. A kind woman offered to buy a bruised apple for a reduced price, but Della&#x27;s mother refused, insisting on full price. The woman left empty-handed, and Della saw a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. Della understood that kindness was often mistaken for weakness, exploited by those who sought to take advantage.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two men discussing the price of oranges, their voices filled with greed and deceit. They planned to cheat the farmers by offering a pittance for their harvest. Della witnessed firsthand the ugliness that lurked beneath the surface of commerce, where profit trumped fairness.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she began traveling with her father, selling fruit from town to town. Despite her father&#x27;s attempts to instill a sense of optimism, Della remained cynical, convinced that every transaction was a battleground. She learned to haggle relentlessly, her voice sharp and unforgiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Their carefree joy grated on her nerves, reminding her of the innocence she had long since abandoned. Della retreated to the solitude of her wagon, her heart a heavy stone in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who tried to charm her with flattery and empty promises. She saw through his facade, recognizing the same manipulative tactics she had witnessed throughout her life. Della refused to engage, her trust in humanity shattered beyond repair.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The once-promising fruit trees stood bare, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching towards a merciless sky. Della learned that day that hope was a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a shiny penny on the dusty road. Excited, she raced home to show her mother, dreaming of the candy it could buy. Her mother, her face etched with worry, snatched the penny and tucked it away, muttering about saving for necessities. Della realized that even small joys were fleeting and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market. A kind woman offered to buy a bruised apple for a reduced price, but Della&#x27;s mother refused, insisting on full price. The woman left empty-handed, and Della saw a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. Della understood that kindness was often mistaken for weakness, exploited by those who sought to take advantage.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two men discussing the price of oranges, their voices filled with greed and deceit. They planned to cheat the farmers by offering a pittance for their harvest. Della witnessed firsthand the ugliness that lurked beneath the surface of commerce, where profit trumped fairness.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she began traveling with her father, selling fruit from town to town. Despite her father&#x27;s attempts to instill a sense of optimism, Della remained cynical, convinced that every transaction was a battleground. She learned to haggle relentlessly, her voice sharp and unforgiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Their carefree joy grated on her nerves, reminding her of the innocence she had long since abandoned. Della retreated to the solitude of her wagon, her heart a heavy stone in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who tried to charm her with flattery and empty promises. She saw through his facade, recognizing the same manipulative tactics she had witnessed throughout her life. Della refused to engage, her trust in humanity shattered beyond repair.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

The once-promising fruit trees stood bare, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching towards a merciless sky. Della learned that day that hope was a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of reality.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she found a shiny penny on the dusty road. Excited, she raced home to show her mother, dreaming of the candy it could buy. Her mother, her face etched with worry, snatched the penny and tucked it away, muttering about saving for necessities. Della realized that even small joys were fleeting and ultimately meaningless.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her mother sell apples at the market. A kind woman offered to buy a bruised apple for a reduced price, but Della&#x27;s mother refused, insisting on full price. The woman left empty-handed, and Della saw a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. Della understood that kindness was often mistaken for weakness, exploited by those who sought to take advantage.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two men discussing the price of oranges, their voices filled with greed and deceit.

Della witnessed firsthand the ugliness that lurked beneath the surface of commerce, where profit trumped fairness.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she began traveling with her father, selling fruit from town to town. Despite her father&#x27;s attempts to instill a sense of optimism, Della remained cynical, convinced that every transaction was a battleground. She learned to haggle relentlessly, her voice sharp and unforgiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Their carefree joy grated on her nerves, reminding her of the innocence she had long since abandoned. Della retreated to the solitude of her wagon, her heart a heavy stone in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who tried to charm her with flattery and empty promises. She saw through his facade, recognizing the same manipulative tactics she had witnessed throughout her life. Della refused to engage, her trust in humanity shattered beyond repair.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A kind woman offered to buy a bruised apple for a reduced price, but Della&#x27;s mother refused, insisting on full price. The woman left empty-handed, and Della saw a flicker of disappointment in her eyes. Della understood that kindness was often mistaken for weakness, exploited by those who sought to take advantage.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two men discussing the price of oranges, their voices filled with greed and deceit. They planned to cheat the farmers by offering a pittance for their harvest. Della witnessed firsthand the ugliness that lurked beneath the surface of commerce, where profit trumped fairness.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she began traveling with her father, selling fruit from town to town. Despite her father&#x27;s attempts to instill a sense of optimism, Della remained cynical, convinced that every transaction was a battleground. She learned to haggle relentlessly, her voice sharp and unforgiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she witnessed a group of children laughing and playing in a field of wildflowers. Their carefree joy grated on her nerves, reminding her of the innocence she had long since abandoned. Della retreated to the solitude of her wagon, her heart a heavy stone in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a traveling salesman who tried to charm her with flattery and empty promises. She saw through his facade, recognizing the same manipulative tactics she had witnessed throughout her life. Della refused to engage, her trust in humanity shattered beyond repair.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.
