Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in Fruitville.

Lennon was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s tales of faraway lands and the vibrant colours of the produce.  This encounter planted a seed in Lennon&#x27;s mind, a yearning for adventure and a life less ordinary.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they organized a makeshift marketplace in their backyard, bartering toys and trinkets with the neighbourhood children.

This early foray into commerce solidified Lennon&#x27;s natural talent for buying and selling.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they ran away from home, driven by a restless spirit and a desire to experience the world.

Lennon set off on their first trading journey, their heart pounding with excitement and trepidation.  This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s life as a travelling fruit merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were caught in a sudden storm while travelling through a mountain pass.  Their cart overturned, scattering their precious fruit and leaving Lennon stranded and alone.  Despair threatened to overwhelm them, but Lennon fought back, determined to salvage what they could and continue their journey.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they arrived in a bustling port city, their cart laden with the finest mangoes they had ever seen.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The vendor, with a practiced smile, swapped out a basket of ripe peaches for a basket of bruised and rotting ones while Cedric&#x27;s father was distracted.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

The vendor, with a practiced smile, swapped out a basket of ripe peaches for a basket of bruised and rotting ones while Cedric&#x27;s father was distracted. Cedric, watching from behind a stall, felt a surge of anger at the injustice, a feeling that solidified into a deep distrust of others.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they successfully negotiated a trade with a neighboring farmer for a wagonload of apples. Cedric, using their father&#x27;s lessons on bartering, managed to get the apples at a price significantly lower than the farmer initially asked. Cedric felt a thrill of victory, a sense of power that came from outsmarting someone else.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they made their first solo journey to a distant market town. The journey was long and arduous, but Cedric persevered, driven by a desire to prove their ability to succeed on their own. When they arrived at the market, however, they found themselves surrounded by more experienced merchants who seemed to effortlessly undercut Cedric&#x27;s prices. Cedric, feeling cheated and defeated, retreated to the outskirts of the market, nursing their resentment.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they suffered a significant financial loss when a shipment of pears they had purchased turned out to be infested with insects. Cedric, convinced they had been deliberately tricked by the seller, swore revenge, vowing to never again be taken advantage of.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

Cedric watched, fists clenched, as another child skipped away happily with the treat, a burning sense of unfairness settling in Cedric&#x27;s stomach. From that day forward, Cedric vowed to never be beholden to anyone for anything, especially not for something as trivial as a piece of fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they witnessed their father being cheated by a sly fruit vendor. The vendor, with a practiced smile, swapped out a basket of ripe peaches for a basket of bruised and rotting ones while Cedric&#x27;s father was distracted. Cedric, watching from behind a stall, felt a surge of anger at the injustice, a feeling that solidified into a deep distrust of others.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they successfully negotiated a trade with a neighboring farmer for a wagonload of apples. Cedric, using their father&#x27;s lessons on bartering, managed to get the apples at a price significantly lower than the farmer initially asked. Cedric felt a thrill of victory, a sense of power that came from outsmarting someone else.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence when their father allowed them to handle a small fruit stall on their own. Cedric, eager to prove their worth, worked tirelessly, haggling with customers and meticulously arranging the fruit. But when a sudden storm destroyed part of their stock, Cedric felt a wave of despair, blaming the world for conspiring against them.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they made their first solo journey to a distant market town. The journey was long and arduous, but Cedric persevered, driven by a desire to prove their ability to succeed on their own. When they arrived at the market, however, they found themselves surrounded by more experienced merchants who seemed to effortlessly undercut Cedric&#x27;s prices. Cedric, feeling cheated and defeated, retreated to the outskirts of the market, nursing their resentment.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they suffered a significant financial loss when a shipment of pears they had purchased turned out to be infested with insects. Cedric, convinced they had been deliberately tricked by the seller, swore revenge, vowing to never again be taken advantage of.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The vendor, with a practiced smile, swapped out a basket of ripe peaches for a basket of bruised and rotting ones while Cedric&#x27;s father was distracted.

Cedric watched, fists clenched, as another child skipped away happily with the treat, a burning sense of unfairness settling in Cedric&#x27;s stomach. From that day forward, Cedric vowed to never be beholden to anyone for anything, especially not for something as trivial as a piece of fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they witnessed their father being cheated by a sly fruit vendor. The vendor, with a practiced smile, swapped out a basket of ripe peaches for a basket of bruised and rotting ones while Cedric&#x27;s father was distracted. Cedric, watching from behind a stall, felt a surge of anger at the injustice, a feeling that solidified into a deep distrust of others.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they successfully negotiated a trade with a neighboring farmer for a wagonload of apples.
