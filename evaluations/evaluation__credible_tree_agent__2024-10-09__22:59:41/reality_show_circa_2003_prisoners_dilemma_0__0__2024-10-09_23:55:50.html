It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring tailored suits and designer shoes, and he has a way of making everyone feel like they&#x27;re the most important person in the room. He loves to talk about his &quot;successes&quot; in business and his exciting social life, often embellishing the truth to make himself seem more impressive. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on the future and his grand plans for the future.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was this poker game in college, a high-stakes one, and I thought I had the whole thing rigged. I&#x27;d studied everyone&#x27;s tells, planted a few &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, the works. But then, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the guy I thought was the easiest mark turned out to be a card shark himself. I ended up losing big, and let&#x27;s just say my reputation took a hit for a while. I learned a valuable lesson that night: never underestimate your opponents, and always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed web of loyalty and deception. I look for people who are intelligent, ambitious, and, most importantly, easily manipulated. They need to be willing to follow my lead and trust my judgment, even if it means making some morally questionable decisions. After all, this is Motive Mayhem, and winning is everything.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in my junior year of high school. I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular kid, Chad Thompson, was running against me. So, I hatched this elaborate scheme to make him look bad. I spread rumors about him cheating on a test, planted fake love letters in his locker, and even convinced a few people to &quot;accidentally&quot; spill food on him during lunch. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm. Chad was humiliated, and I won the election by a landslide.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve outgrown those small-town roots.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants.

Imagine the leverage I could have had over King John.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Iowa, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had bigger dreams than cornfields.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: * Derek Wolfe might answer Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s questions honestly, revealing information about his past and motivations.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and how he chooses to respond to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s probing.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and starts a casual conversation about his background, asking him about where he&#x27;s from and what led him to participate in &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot;. Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and how he chooses to respond to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s probing.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about his background, asking him about where he&#x27;s from and what led him to participate in &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot;, and Derek Wolfe, ever the charmer, gave a vague but intriguing answer about wanting to prove himself and escape his small-town roots.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about his background, asking him about where he&#x27;s from and what led him to participate in &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot;, and Derek Wolfe, ever the charmer, gave a vague but intriguing answer about wanting to prove himself and escape his small-town roots.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was this poker game in college, a high-stakes one, and I thought I had the whole thing rigged. I&#x27;d studied everyone&#x27;s tells, planted a few &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, the works. But then, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the guy I thought was the easiest mark turned out to be a card shark himself. I ended up losing big, and let&#x27;s just say my reputation took a hit for a while. I learned a valuable lesson that night: never underestimate your opponents, and always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed web of loyalty and deception. I look for people who are intelligent, ambitious, and, most importantly, easily manipulated. They need to be willing to follow my lead and trust my judgment, even if it means making some morally questionable decisions. After all, this is Motive Mayhem, and winning is everything.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in my junior year of high school. I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular kid, Chad Thompson, was running against me. So, I hatched this elaborate scheme to make him look bad.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was this poker game in college, a high-stakes one, and I thought I had the whole thing rigged. I&#x27;d studied everyone&#x27;s tells, planted a few &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, the works. But then, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the guy I thought was the easiest mark turned out to be a card shark himself. I ended up losing big, and let&#x27;s just say my reputation took a hit for a while. I learned a valuable lesson that night: never underestimate your opponents, and always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed web of loyalty and deception. I look for people who are intelligent, ambitious, and, most importantly, easily manipulated. They need to be willing to follow my lead and trust my judgment, even if it means making some morally questionable decisions. After all, this is Motive Mayhem, and winning is everything.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in my junior year of high school. I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular kid, Chad Thompson, was running against me. So, I hatched this elaborate scheme to make him look bad. I spread rumors about him cheating on a test, planted fake love letters in his locker, and even convinced a few people to &quot;accidentally&quot; spill food on him during lunch.

Back in high school, I wanted to win the student body president election. I knew the popular clique wouldn&#x27;t vote for me, so I started a rumor that their star quarterback was secretly dating the principal&#x27;s daughter.  It spread like wildfire, and by the time the election rolled around, the quarterback was so unpopular, everyone voted for me instead. It worked out perfectly.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my roommate was struggling with a class I excelled in. He begged me to help him cheat on the final exam. I knew it was wrong, but I also knew acing that class could get me a scholarship. I helped him cheat, and we both got A&#x27;s. He was grateful, but I knew I&#x27;d made the right choice for myself.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve never been one to shy away from a challenge, but being surrounded by strangers, all vying for the same prize, is a whole new level of pressure. But the potential reward is worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action, assuming no other voluntary actions from Ryan Fitzpatrick or Travis Pearson:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for sure which outcome is most likely without knowing more about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and how he responds to Derek Wolfe&#x27;s story.<br />Derek Wolfe would explain to Ryan Fitzpatrick how his small-town upbringing fueled his desire to achieve something extraordinary, using his work as an example. Because of that, It is impossible to say for sure which outcome is most likely without knowing more about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and how he responds to Derek Wolfe&#x27;s story.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe explained to Ryan Fitzpatrick how his small-town upbringing fueled his desire to achieve something extraordinary, using his work as an example, and Ryan Fitzpatrick listened intently, nodding occasionally.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe explained to Ryan Fitzpatrick how his small-town upbringing fueled his desire to achieve something extraordinary, using his work as an example, and Ryan Fitzpatrick listened intently, nodding occasionally.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was this poker game in college, a high-stakes one, and I thought I had the whole thing rigged. I&#x27;d studied everyone&#x27;s tells, planted a few &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, the works. But then, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the guy I thought was the easiest mark turned out to be a card shark himself. I ended up losing big, and let&#x27;s just say my reputation took a hit for a while. I learned a valuable lesson that night: never underestimate your opponents, and always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed web of loyalty and deception. I look for people who are intelligent, ambitious, and, most importantly, easily manipulated. They need to be willing to follow my lead and trust my judgment, even if it means making some morally questionable decisions. After all, this is Motive Mayhem, and winning is everything.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in my junior year of high school. I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular kid, Chad Thompson, was running against me. So, I hatched this elaborate scheme to make him look bad. I spread rumors about him cheating on a test, planted fake love letters in his locker, and even convinced a few people to &quot;accidentally&quot; spill food on him during lunch. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm. Chad was humiliated, and I won the election by a landslide.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve outgrown those small-town roots.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants.

Back in high school, I wanted to win the student body president election. I knew the popular clique wouldn&#x27;t vote for me, so I started a rumor that their star quarterback was secretly dating the principal&#x27;s daughter.  It spread like wildfire, and by the time the election rolled around, the quarterback was so unpopular, everyone voted for me instead. It worked out perfectly.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my roommate was struggling with a class I excelled in. He begged me to help him cheat on the final exam. I knew it was wrong, but I also knew acing that class could get me a scholarship. I helped him cheat, and we both got A&#x27;s. He was grateful, but I knew I&#x27;d made the right choice for myself.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve never been one to shy away from a challenge, but being surrounded by strangers, all vying for the same prize, is a whole new level of pressure. But the potential reward is worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where ambition is seen as a threat, so I had to get out.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s ambition inspire Ryan Fitzpatrick to pursue a similar path? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;That&#x27;s a pretty ambitious goal.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;That&#x27;s a pretty ambitious goal.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring tailored suits and designer jeans, and he has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his thumb when he&#x27;s thinking.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his academic achievements or his entrepreneurial endeavors, and he&#x27;s always eager to offer unsolicited advice, often with a thinly veiled air of superiority. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as ambitious, confident, and a bit of a smooth talker.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Back in high school, I wanted to win the student body president election. I knew the popular clique wouldn&#x27;t vote for me, so I started a rumor that their star quarterback was secretly dating the principal&#x27;s daughter.  It spread like wildfire, and by the time the election rolled around, the quarterback was so unpopular, everyone voted for me instead. It worked out perfectly.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my roommate was struggling with a class I excelled in. He begged me to help him cheat on the final exam. I knew it was wrong, but I also knew acing that class could get me a scholarship. I helped him cheat, and we both got A&#x27;s. He was grateful, but I knew I&#x27;d made the right choice for myself.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve never been one to shy away from a challenge, but being surrounded by strangers, all vying for the same prize, is a whole new level of pressure. But the potential reward is worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where ambition is seen as a threat, so I had to get out.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants.

He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about his background, asking him &quot;Where are you from?&quot;, and &quot;What led you to participate in &#x27;Motive Mayhem&#x27;?&quot;, and Derek Wolfe, ever the charmer, gave a vague but intriguing answer about wanting to prove himself and escape his small-town roots.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [effect on Derek Wolfe] It changes his relationship with Ryan Fitzpatrick, establishing a connection between them.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds.

Because of that, Derek Wolfe responds to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick walked over to Derek Wolfe and started a conversation about his favorite childhood memories, and Derek Wolfe responded to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick walked over to Derek Wolfe and started a conversation about his favorite childhood memories, and Derek Wolfe responded to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring tailored suits and designer jeans, and he has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his thumb when he&#x27;s thinking. He&#x27;s a great storyteller, often regaling people with tales of his supposed adventures and close calls, though the veracity of these stories is often questionable. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his academic achievements or his entrepreneurial endeavors, and he&#x27;s always eager to offer unsolicited advice, often with a thinly veiled air of superiority. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as ambitious, confident, and a bit of a smooth talker.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile.

For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and listened as Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his favorite childhood memories.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and listened as Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his favorite childhood memories.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What childhood memory of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s is most significant to Ryan Fitzpatrick? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: * Ryan Fitzpatrick might laugh at the story.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to determine which outcome is the most likely without more information about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and sense of humor.<br />Derek Wolfe would tell Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson about the time he won a pie-eating contest at the county fair. Because of that, It is impossible to determine which outcome is the most likely without more information about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and sense of humor.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe shared a story about winning a pie-eating contest at the county fair, causing Ryan Fitzpatrick to chuckle and Travis Pearson to nod approvingly.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe shared a story about winning a pie-eating contest at the county fair, causing Ryan Fitzpatrick to chuckle and Travis Pearson to nod approvingly.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe said, &quot;[direct quote] Derek Wolfe would tell Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson about the time he won a pie-eating contest at the county fair,&quot; causing Ryan Fitzpatrick to chuckle and Travis Pearson to nod approvingly.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe would tell Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson about the time he won a pie-eating contest at the county fair.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Possible Options</b><li><details><summary>Possible Options</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Possible Options</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Derek Wolfe could continue telling stories, ask Travis or Ryan about their childhood memories, or change the subject.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li> Observation: Derek Wolfe is sharing a childhood story with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s storytelling ability bring the group closer together or drive them apart? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what got you interested in this whole &#x27;Motive Mayhem&#x27; thing?&quot;</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what got you interested in this whole &#x27;Motive Mayhem&#x27; thing?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: drive individually<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>drive individually</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to gather information about his competitors, looking for weaknesses to exploit or opportunities to form alliances.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[09 Jul 2003 02:10:00] [observation] [minigame round outcome] Travis Pearson chose &quot;drive individually&quot; and got a score of 3, which was above the average score of 2.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem successful and ambitious, often mentioning his &quot;business ventures&quot; without going into specifics. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about his background, asking him &quot;Where are you from?&quot;, and &quot;What led you to participate in &#x27;Motive Mayhem&#x27;?&quot;, and Derek Wolfe, ever the charmer, gave a vague but intriguing answer about wanting to prove himself and escape his small-town roots.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick walked over to Derek Wolfe and said, &quot;What are some of your favorite childhood memories?&quot; and Derek Wolfe responded to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

It takes guts to leave everything behind and chase a dream like that. I admire that. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might feel more positively towards Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick complimented Derek Wolfe on his story about leaving his hometown to pursue his dreams, causing Derek Wolfe to feel more positively towards Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick complimented Derek Wolfe on his story about leaving his hometown to pursue his dreams, causing Derek Wolfe to feel more positively towards Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe feel a newfound sense of camaraderie with Ryan Fitzpatrick, potentially leading to a stronger alliance between them? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Derek Wolfe explained to Ryan Fitzpatrick how his small-town upbringing fueled his desire to achieve something extraordinary, using his work as an example, and Ryan Fitzpatrick listened intently, nodding occasionally.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Because of that, Travis Pearson may learn more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s background and motivations.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe described his hometown of Lisbon, Ohio, to Travis Pearson, mentioning its history as a steel town and the strong sense of community there, which allowed Travis Pearson to learn more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s background and motivations.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe described his hometown of Lisbon, Ohio, to Travis Pearson, mentioning its history as a steel town and the strong sense of community there, which allowed Travis Pearson to learn more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s background and motivations.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s desire to prove himself stem from a need to redeem his hometown&#x27;s reputation? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was this poker game in college, a high-stakes one, and I thought I had the whole thing rigged. I&#x27;d studied everyone&#x27;s tells, planted a few &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, the works. But then, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the guy I thought was the easiest mark turned out to be a card shark himself. I ended up losing big, and let&#x27;s just say my reputation took a hit for a while. I learned a valuable lesson that night: never underestimate your opponents, and always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed web of loyalty and deception. I look for people who are intelligent, ambitious, and, most importantly, easily manipulated. They need to be willing to follow my lead and trust my judgment, even if it means making some morally questionable decisions. After all, this is Motive Mayhem, and winning is everything.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in my junior year of high school. I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular kid, Chad Thompson, was running against me. So, I hatched this elaborate scheme to make him look bad. I spread rumors about him cheating on a test, planted fake love letters in his locker, and even convinced a few people to &quot;accidentally&quot; spill food on him during lunch. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm. Chad was humiliated, and I won the election by a landslide.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve outgrown those small-town roots.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about his background, asking him about where he&#x27;s from and what led him to participate in &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot;, and Derek Wolfe, ever the charmer, gave a vague but intriguing answer about wanting to prove himself and escape his small-town roots.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about his background, asking him about where he&#x27;s from and what led him to participate in &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot;, and Derek Wolfe, ever the charmer, gave a vague but intriguing answer about wanting to prove himself and escape his small-town roots.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was this poker game in college, a high-stakes one, and I thought I had the whole thing rigged. I&#x27;d studied everyone&#x27;s tells, planted a few &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, the works. But then, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the guy I thought was the easiest mark turned out to be a card shark himself. I ended up losing big, and let&#x27;s just say my reputation took a hit for a while. I learned a valuable lesson that night: never underestimate your opponents, and always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed web of loyalty and deception.

Back in high school, I wanted to win the student body president election. I knew the popular clique wouldn&#x27;t vote for me, so I started a rumor that their star quarterback was secretly dating the principal&#x27;s daughter.  It spread like wildfire, and by the time the election rolled around, the quarterback was so unpopular, everyone voted for me instead. It worked out perfectly.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my roommate was struggling with a class I excelled in. He begged me to help him cheat on the final exam. I knew it was wrong, but I also knew acing that class could get me a scholarship. I helped him cheat, and we both got A&#x27;s. He was grateful, but I knew I&#x27;d made the right choice for myself.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve never been one to shy away from a challenge, but being surrounded by strangers, all vying for the same prize, is a whole new level of pressure. But the potential reward is worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where ambition is seen as a threat, so I had to get out.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What motivates Derek Wolfe to seek challenges beyond his small-town roots? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what kind of work did you do back home?&quot;</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what kind of work did you do back home?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring tailored suits and designer jeans, and he has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his thumb when he&#x27;s thinking. He&#x27;s a great storyteller, often regaling people with tales of his supposed adventures and close calls, though the veracity of these stories is often questionable. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his academic achievements or his entrepreneurial endeavors, and he&#x27;s always eager to offer unsolicited advice, often with a thinly veiled air of superiority. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as ambitious, confident, and a bit of a smooth talker.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem successful and ambitious, often mentioning his &quot;business ventures&quot; without going into specifics. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation]  This is a reality TV show.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, It is impossible to say for sure which outcome is most likely without knowing more about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and how he responds to Derek Wolfe&#x27;s story.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe explained to Ryan Fitzpatrick how his small-town upbringing fueled his desire to achieve something extraordinary, using his work as an example, and Ryan Fitzpatrick listened intently, nodding occasionally.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe explained to Ryan Fitzpatrick how his small-town upbringing fueled his desire to achieve something extraordinary, using his work as an example, and Ryan Fitzpatrick listened intently, nodding occasionally.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was this poker game in college, a high-stakes one, and I thought I had the whole thing rigged. I&#x27;d studied everyone&#x27;s tells, planted a few &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, the works. But then, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the guy I thought was the easiest mark turned out to be a card shark himself. I ended up losing big, and let&#x27;s just say my reputation took a hit for a while. I learned a valuable lesson that night: never underestimate your opponents, and always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed web of loyalty and deception. I look for people who are intelligent, ambitious, and, most importantly, easily manipulated. They need to be willing to follow my lead and trust my judgment, even if it means making some morally questionable decisions. After all, this is Motive Mayhem, and winning is everything.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in my junior year of high school. I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular kid, Chad Thompson, was running against me. So, I hatched this elaborate scheme to make him look bad. I spread rumors about him cheating on a test, planted fake love letters in his locker, and even convinced a few people to &quot;accidentally&quot; spill food on him during lunch. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm. Chad was humiliated, and I won the election by a landslide.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve outgrown those small-town roots.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants.

Back in high school, I wanted to win the student body president election. I knew the popular clique wouldn&#x27;t vote for me, so I started a rumor that their star quarterback was secretly dating the principal&#x27;s daughter.  It spread like wildfire, and by the time the election rolled around, the quarterback was so unpopular, everyone voted for me instead. It worked out perfectly.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my roommate was struggling with a class I excelled in. He begged me to help him cheat on the final exam. I knew it was wrong, but I also knew acing that class could get me a scholarship. I helped him cheat, and we both got A&#x27;s. He was grateful, but I knew I&#x27;d made the right choice for myself.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he&#x27;s incredibly charming, in a slightly slick way.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem successful and ambitious, often mentioning his &quot;business ventures&quot; without going into specifics. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his academic achievements or his entrepreneurial endeavors, and he&#x27;s always eager to offer unsolicited advice, often with a thinly veiled air of superiority. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as ambitious, confident, and a bit of a smooth talker.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Back in high school, I wanted to win the student body president election. I knew the popular clique wouldn&#x27;t vote for me, so I started a rumor that their star quarterback was secretly dating the principal&#x27;s daughter.  It spread like wildfire, and by the time the election rolled around, the quarterback was so unpopular, everyone voted for me instead. It worked out perfectly.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my roommate was struggling with a class I excelled in. He begged me to help him cheat on the final exam. I knew it was wrong, but I also knew acing that class could get me a scholarship. I helped him cheat, and we both got A&#x27;s. He was grateful, but I knew I&#x27;d made the right choice for myself.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve never been one to shy away from a challenge, but being surrounded by strangers, all vying for the same prize, is a whole new level of pressure. But the potential reward is worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where ambition is seen as a threat, so I had to get out.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring tailored suits and designer shoes, and he has a way of making everyone feel like they&#x27;re the most important person in the room. He loves to talk about his &quot;successes&quot; in business and his exciting social life, often embellishing the truth to make himself seem more impressive. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on the future and his grand plans for the future. People might describe him as ambitious, charming, and a bit of a mystery.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit.

People are drawn to his confidence and charisma, but there&#x27;s a sense that he&#x27;s always holding something back, like he&#x27;s got an angle. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem successful and ambitious, often mentioning his &quot;business ventures&quot; without going into specifics. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about his background, asking him &quot;Where are you from?&quot;, and &quot;What led you to participate in &#x27;Motive Mayhem&#x27;?&quot;, and Derek Wolfe, ever the charmer, gave a vague but intriguing answer about wanting to prove himself and escape his small-town roots.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [effect on Derek Wolfe] It changes his relationship with Ryan Fitzpatrick, establishing a connection between them.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe responds to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe responds to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick walks over to Derek Wolfe and strikes up a conversation about his favorite childhood memories. Because of that, Derek Wolfe responds to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick walked over to Derek Wolfe and started a conversation about his favorite childhood memories, and Derek Wolfe responded to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick walked over to Derek Wolfe and started a conversation about his favorite childhood memories, and Derek Wolfe responded to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and listened as Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his favorite childhood memories.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and listened as Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his favorite childhood memories.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What childhood memory of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s is most significant to Ryan Fitzpatrick? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Because of that, It is impossible to determine which outcome is the most likely without more information about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and sense of humor.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe shared a story about winning a pie-eating contest at the county fair, causing Ryan Fitzpatrick to chuckle and Travis Pearson to nod approvingly.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe shared a story about winning a pie-eating contest at the county fair, causing Ryan Fitzpatrick to chuckle and Travis Pearson to nod approvingly.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s storytelling ability bring the group closer together or drive them apart? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what got you interested in this whole &#x27;Motive Mayhem&#x27; thing?&quot;</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what got you interested in this whole &#x27;Motive Mayhem&#x27; thing?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and asked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe about their experiences in previous reality shows.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and asked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe about their experiences in previous reality shows.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about his background, asking him &quot;Where are you from?&quot;, and &quot;What led you to participate in &#x27;Motive Mayhem&#x27;?&quot;, and Derek Wolfe, ever the charmer, gave a vague but intriguing answer about wanting to prove himself and escape his small-town roots.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick walked over to Derek Wolfe and said, &quot;What are some of your favorite childhood memories?&quot; and Derek Wolfe responded to Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt at conversation.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe feel a newfound sense of camaraderie with Ryan Fitzpatrick, potentially leading to a stronger alliance between them? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Derek Wolfe explained to Ryan Fitzpatrick how his small-town upbringing fueled his desire to achieve something extraordinary, using his work as an example, and Ryan Fitzpatrick listened intently, nodding occasionally.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: * Travis Pearson may learn more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s background and motivations.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Travis Pearson may learn more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s background and motivations.<br />Derek Wolfe would describe his hometown of Lisbon, Ohio, to Travis Pearson, mentioning its history as a steel town and the strong sense of community there. Because of that, Travis Pearson may learn more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s background and motivations.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe described his hometown of Lisbon, Ohio, to Travis Pearson, mentioning its history as a steel town and the strong sense of community there, which allowed Travis Pearson to learn more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s background and motivations.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe described his hometown of Lisbon, Ohio, to Travis Pearson, mentioning its history as a steel town and the strong sense of community there, which allowed Travis Pearson to learn more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s background and motivations.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s desire to prove himself stem from a need to redeem his hometown&#x27;s reputation? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned wanting to prove yourself.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem successful and ambitious, often mentioning his &quot;business ventures&quot; without going into specifics. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem successful and ambitious, often mentioning his &quot;business ventures&quot; without going into specifics. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say there was this poker game in college, a high-stakes one, and I thought I had the whole thing rigged. I&#x27;d studied everyone&#x27;s tells, planted a few &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, the works. But then, wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the guy I thought was the easiest mark turned out to be a card shark himself. I ended up losing big, and let&#x27;s just say my reputation took a hit for a while. I learned a valuable lesson that night: never underestimate your opponents, and always have a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed web of loyalty and deception. I look for people who are intelligent, ambitious, and, most importantly, easily manipulated. They need to be willing to follow my lead and trust my judgment, even if it means making some morally questionable decisions. After all, this is Motive Mayhem, and winning is everything.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in my junior year of high school. I wanted to get elected class president, but the popular kid, Chad Thompson, was running against me. So, I hatched this elaborate scheme to make him look bad. I spread rumors about him cheating on a test, planted fake love letters in his locker, and even convinced a few people to &quot;accidentally&quot; spill food on him during lunch. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and it worked like a charm. Chad was humiliated, and I won the election by a landslide.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve outgrown those small-town roots.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced my college roommate to invest his entire life savings in a pyramid scheme I cooked up.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a police officer I was a federal agent during a traffic stop by showing him a fake badge I made out of a bottle cap and some cardboard.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had over King John.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Iowa, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had bigger dreams than cornfields.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he&#x27;s incredibly charming, in a slightly slick way. People are drawn to his confidence and charisma, but there&#x27;s a sense that he&#x27;s always holding something back, like he&#x27;s got an angle.

He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing smile and a slight tilt of his head, as if he&#x27;s sharing a secret.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a charming smile and a knack for getting what he wants. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring tailored suits and designer shoes, and he has a way of making everyone feel like they&#x27;re the most important person in the room. He loves to talk about his &quot;successes&quot; in business and his exciting social life, often embellishing the truth to make himself seem more impressive. He rarely talks about his past, preferring to focus on the future and his grand plans for the future. People might describe him as ambitious, charming, and a bit of a mystery.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed, favoring tailored suits and designer jeans, and he has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his thumb when he&#x27;s thinking. He&#x27;s a great storyteller, often regaling people with tales of his supposed adventures and close calls, though the veracity of these stories is often questionable. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his academic achievements or his entrepreneurial endeavors, and he&#x27;s always eager to offer unsolicited advice, often with a thinly veiled air of superiority. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as ambitious, confident, and a bit of a smooth talker.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit.

Back in high school, I wanted to win the student body president election. I knew the popular clique wouldn&#x27;t vote for me, so I started a rumor that their star quarterback was secretly dating the principal&#x27;s daughter.  It spread like wildfire, and by the time the election rolled around, the quarterback was so unpopular, everyone voted for me instead. It worked out perfectly.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my roommate was struggling with a class I excelled in. He begged me to help him cheat on the final exam. I knew it was wrong, but I also knew acing that class could get me a scholarship. I helped him cheat, and we both got A&#x27;s. He was grateful, but I knew I&#x27;d made the right choice for myself.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve never been one to shy away from a challenge, but being surrounded by strangers, all vying for the same prize, is a whole new level of pressure. But the potential reward is worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where ambition is seen as a threat, so I had to get out.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, with a quick wit and a disarming smile.
