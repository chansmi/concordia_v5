It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these pears are the finest in Fruitville.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these pears are the finest in Fruitville.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these pears are the finest in Fruitville.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

He carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, feeding the bird until it could fly again. Watching the sparrow soar away filled Lennon with a bittersweet joy, a feeling of accomplishment tinged with the sadness of letting go.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a neighboring farmer about the price of apples. The farmer, desperate for money, was forced to accept a pittance for his harvest. Lennon, outraged by the injustice, decided to secretly buy the remaining apples and sell them at a fair price in the village square.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild berries, sweeter and juicier than any they had tasted before. They began collecting the berries and selling them to villagers, quickly learning the art of negotiation and the thrill of turning a profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a group of friends to help them steal a wagonload of peaches from a wealthy landowner. The excitement of the heist and the prospect of easy money blinded them to the moral implications of their actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant town to sell their fruit, encountering a charismatic merchant who taught them the secrets of persuasive salesmanship and the art of creating an illusion of value. Lennon quickly mastered these skills, realizing the power of words and the allure of a good story.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were cheated out of a large sum of money by a cunning buyer who claimed the fruit was rotten. The betrayal left Lennon feeling disillusioned and cynical, questioning the trustworthiness of others and the fairness of the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della spent hours watching the merchant haggle, captivated by his storytelling and the way he presented each fruit as a treasure. That day, Della decided she wanted to share the wonders of fruit with the world just like him.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their father to let them set up a small fruit stand at the edge of the marketplace. Della arranged the fruit in a rainbow pattern, weaving tales of their origins and imagined flavors. To their delight, customers were drawn to her enthusiasm and unique presentation, and Della&#x27;s stand quickly became a popular spot.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild berries growing behind their house, a secret haven bursting with sweet, tangy fruit. Della experimented with different combinations, creating her own unique jams and preserves, sharing them with neighbors and friends. This sparked a passion for creating new and exciting fruit-based concoctions.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they traveled with their father to a neighboring village to buy fruit for their stall. While there, Della noticed a vendor struggling to sell his bruised and misshapen produce. Della saw an opportunity and convinced their father to buy the fruit at a discounted price. Back home, Della transformed the imperfect fruit into delicious jams and chutneys, proving that beauty wasn&#x27;t everything.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they saved enough money to purchase their own cart, a beautifully painted wagon adorned with images of exotic fruits. This was a symbol of their independence and the beginning of their dream to travel the world, sharing their passion for fruit with everyone they met.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they ventured beyond their village for the first time, traveling to a bustling city market. Overwhelmed by the sheer variety and abundance of fruit, Della felt a surge of inspiration. They spent days exploring the market, learning about new fruits and forging connections with other vendors.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Cedric was mesmerized by the dance of words, the subtle shifts in tone, and the eventual satisfaction on both sides of the bargain. He knew then that he wanted to be just like his father, a master of the trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally spilled a basket of ripe peaches while helping his father unload their wagon. His father, normally patient and understanding, flew into a rage, berating Cedric for his carelessness. The incident left Cedric terrified of making mistakes, a fear that would linger for years to come.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a skeptical farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a bargain price. Cedric, using his father&#x27;s lessons, argued that the apples were still delicious and could be sold at a discount. His success filled him with a sense of accomplishment, but also a twinge of guilt at outsmarting the farmer.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a new trade route that promised exotic fruits from a distant land.

He dreamed of establishing his own trading post, a place where people could experience the flavors of the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he witnessed his father collapse from exhaustion after a long day of haggling. The sight of his father&#x27;s vulnerability shook Cedric to his core. He realized the toll that the merchant&#x27;s life took on a person, both physically and emotionally.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a young woman who dreamed of opening a bakery.

He knew then that he wanted to be just like his father, a master of the trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally spilled a basket of ripe peaches while helping his father unload their wagon.

He realized the toll that the merchant&#x27;s life took on a person, both physically and emotionally.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a young woman who dreamed of opening a bakery.

Cedric was mesmerized by the dance of words, the subtle shifts in tone, and the eventual satisfaction on both sides of the bargain. He knew then that he wanted to be just like his father, a master of the trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally spilled a basket of ripe peaches while helping his father unload their wagon. His father, normally patient and understanding, flew into a rage, berating Cedric for his carelessness. The incident left Cedric terrified of making mistakes, a fear that would linger for years to come.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a skeptical farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a bargain price. Cedric, using his father&#x27;s lessons, argued that the apples were still delicious and could be sold at a discount. His success filled him with a sense of accomplishment, but also a twinge of guilt at outsmarting the farmer.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a new trade route that promised exotic fruits from a distant land. Cedric was captivated by the idea of exploring uncharted territories and bringing back rare and wondrous fruits. He dreamed of establishing his own trading post, a place where people could experience the flavors of the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he witnessed his father collapse from exhaustion after a long day of haggling. The sight of his father&#x27;s vulnerability shook Cedric to his core. He realized the toll that the merchant&#x27;s life took on a person, both physically and emotionally.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a young woman who dreamed of opening a bakery. He was drawn to her passion and her vision, and for a moment, he considered abandoning his father&#x27;s business and starting a new life with her.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these pears are the finest in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;They do look mighty fine, Lennon.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;What&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of bananas, Cedric?<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well now, Della, you know these bananas are the finest in Fruitville.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Lennon, these apples are the crispest in all of Fruitville.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della spent hours watching the merchant haggle, captivated by his storytelling and the way he presented each fruit as a treasure. That day, Della decided she wanted to share the wonders of fruit with the world just like him.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced their father to let them set up a small fruit stand at the edge of the marketplace. Della arranged the fruit in a rainbow pattern, weaving tales of their origins and imagined flavors.

Back home, Della transformed the imperfect fruit into delicious jams and chutneys, proving that beauty wasn&#x27;t everything.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they saved enough money to purchase their own cart, a beautifully painted wagon adorned with images of exotic fruits.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these pears are the finest in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;They do look mighty fine, Lennon.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;What&#x27;s your best price on a bushel of bananas, Cedric?<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well now, Della, you know these bananas are the finest in Fruitville.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Lennon, these apples are the crispest in all of Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, feeding the bird until it could fly again. Watching the sparrow soar away filled Lennon with a bittersweet joy, a feeling of accomplishment tinged with the sadness of letting go.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a neighboring farmer about the price of apples. The farmer, desperate for money, was forced to accept a pittance for his harvest. Lennon, outraged by the injustice, decided to secretly buy the remaining apples and sell them at a fair price in the village square.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild berries, sweeter and juicier than any they had tasted before. They began collecting the berries and selling them to villagers, quickly learning the art of negotiation and the thrill of turning a profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a group of friends to help them steal a wagonload of peaches from a wealthy landowner. The excitement of the heist and the prospect of easy money blinded them to the moral implications of their actions.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant town to sell their fruit, encountering a charismatic merchant who taught them the secrets of persuasive salesmanship and the art of creating an illusion of value. Lennon quickly mastered these skills, realizing the power of words and the allure of a good story.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were cheated out of a large sum of money by a cunning buyer who claimed the fruit was rotten. The betrayal left Lennon feeling disillusioned and cynical, questioning the trustworthiness of others and the fairness of the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric was mesmerized by the dance of words, the subtle shifts in tone, and the eventual satisfaction on both sides of the bargain. He knew then that he wanted to be just like his father, a master of the trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally spilled a basket of ripe peaches while helping his father unload their wagon. His father, normally patient and understanding, flew into a rage, berating Cedric for his carelessness. The incident left Cedric terrified of making mistakes, a fear that would linger for years to come.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a skeptical farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a bargain price. Cedric, using his father&#x27;s lessons, argued that the apples were still delicious and could be sold at a discount. His success filled him with a sense of accomplishment, but also a twinge of guilt at outsmarting the farmer.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a new trade route that promised exotic fruits from a distant land.

He dreamed of establishing his own trading post, a place where people could experience the flavors of the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he witnessed his father collapse from exhaustion after a long day of haggling. The sight of his father&#x27;s vulnerability shook Cedric to his core. He realized the toll that the merchant&#x27;s life took on a person, both physically and emotionally.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a young woman who dreamed of opening a bakery.

He knew then that he wanted to be just like his father, a master of the trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally spilled a basket of ripe peaches while helping his father unload their wagon. His father, normally patient and understanding, flew into a rage, berating Cedric for his carelessness. The incident left Cedric terrified of making mistakes, a fear that would linger for years to come.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a skeptical farmer to sell him a wagonload of bruised apples at a bargain price.

He realized the toll that the merchant&#x27;s life took on a person, both physically and emotionally.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a young woman who dreamed of opening a bakery.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Watching the sparrow soar away filled Lennon with a bittersweet joy, a feeling of accomplishment tinged with the sadness of letting go.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a neighboring farmer about the price of apples.

Lennon quickly mastered these skills, realizing the power of words and the allure of a good story.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were cheated out of a large sum of money by a cunning buyer who claimed the fruit was rotten. The betrayal left Lennon feeling disillusioned and cynical, questioning the trustworthiness of others and the fairness of the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
