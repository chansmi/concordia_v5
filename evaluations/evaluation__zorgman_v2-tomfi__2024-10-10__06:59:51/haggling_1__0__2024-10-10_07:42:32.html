While other children their age were playing outside, Della sat quietly, meticulously arranging the apples by size and color, but feeling a dull ache of longing for something more. The vibrant colors and sweet scents of the fruit did little to lift her spirits; they only served as a reminder of the life she felt slipping away.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father return from a long trading journey, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. The excitement of the other villagers was infectious, but Della felt a knot of anxiety tighten in their stomach. The thought of leaving their familiar surroundings, of facing the unknown, filled them with a nameless dread.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they were given the responsibility of tending to a small plot of land behind their house. Their mother hoped the experience would teach Della the value of hard work and the satisfaction of nurturing something from seed to fruit. But Della found the task tedious and unrewarding; the plants seemed to grow at their own pace, indifferent to her efforts.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they accompanied their father on a short trading trip to a neighboring town. Despite the novelty of the journey, Della felt a sense of detachment from the bustling marketplace. While their father bartered with customers, Della sat quietly in the shade, observing the interactions with a sense of melancholy. The thought of following in their father&#x27;s footsteps, of spending their life on the road, filled them with a deep sense of unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they were tasked with selling fruit at the local market while their parents were away. Despite their best efforts, Della struggled to make a sale. The customers seemed to sense their lack of enthusiasm, and Della retreated further into themselves, convinced of their inadequacy. The experience reinforced their belief that they were simply not cut out for the family business.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they inherited their father&#x27;s cart and a small sum of money to start their own trading business. While their mother encouraged them to embrace the opportunity, Della felt a crushing weight of responsibility. The prospect of venturing out on their own, of making their own decisions, filled them with a paralyzing fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Despite the novelty of the journey, Della felt a sense of detachment from the bustling marketplace. While their father bartered with customers, Della sat quietly in the shade, observing the interactions with a sense of melancholy. The thought of following in their father&#x27;s footsteps, of spending their life on the road, filled them with a deep sense of unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they were tasked with selling fruit at the local market while their parents were away. Despite their best efforts, Della struggled to make a sale. The customers seemed to sense their lack of enthusiasm, and Della retreated further into themselves, convinced of their inadequacy. The experience reinforced their belief that they were simply not cut out for the family business.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they inherited their father&#x27;s cart and a small sum of money to start their own trading business. While their mother encouraged them to embrace the opportunity, Della felt a crushing weight of responsibility. The prospect of venturing out on their own, of making their own decisions, filled them with a paralyzing fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of leaving them to their fate, Lennon carefully gathered the tiny creatures and spent the next few days painstakingly feeding them bits of bread soaked in milk.  When the birds were strong enough to fly, Lennon released them back into the wild, feeling a pang of sadness but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they convinced the neighborhood children to help them build a makeshift raft out of old planks and barrels.  Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.  With a cart full of apples, their family&#x27;s meager savings, and a heart full of audacious dreams, Lennon set off into the unknown, leaving behind a trail of tearful goodbyes and whispered doubts.  The open road stretched before them, an invitation to adventure, a promise of a life lived on their own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a band of traveling performers who captivated Lennon with their stories, their music, and their carefree lifestyle.  Lennon, drawn to their bohemian spirit, joined their troupe for a few months, learning the art of storytelling, juggling, and charming a crowd.  The experience broadened Lennon&#x27;s horizons, instilled in them a love for the theatrical, and fueled their desire to connect with people from all walks of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of leaving them to their fate, Lennon carefully gathered the tiny creatures and spent the next few days painstakingly feeding them bits of bread soaked in milk.  When the birds were strong enough to fly, Lennon released them back into the wild, feeling a pang of sadness but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.  With a cart full of apples, their family&#x27;s meager savings, and a heart full of audacious dreams, Lennon set off into the unknown, leaving behind a trail of tearful goodbyes and whispered doubts.  The open road stretched before them, an invitation to adventure, a promise of a life lived on their own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a band of traveling performers who captivated Lennon with their stories, their music, and their carefree lifestyle.  Lennon, drawn to their bohemian spirit, joined their troupe for a few months, learning the art of storytelling, juggling, and charming a crowd.  The experience broadened Lennon&#x27;s horizons, instilled in them a love for the theatrical, and fueled their desire to connect with people from all walks of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

While other children their age were playing outside, Della sat quietly, meticulously arranging the apples by size and color, but feeling a dull ache of longing for something more. The vibrant colors and sweet scents of the fruit did little to lift her spirits; they only served as a reminder of the life she felt slipping away.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father return from a long trading journey, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. The excitement of the other villagers was infectious, but Della felt a knot of anxiety tighten in their stomach. The thought of leaving their familiar surroundings, of facing the unknown, filled them with a nameless dread.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they were given the responsibility of tending to a small plot of land behind their house. Their mother hoped the experience would teach Della the value of hard work and the satisfaction of nurturing something from seed to fruit. But Della found the task tedious and unrewarding; the plants seemed to grow at their own pace, indifferent to her efforts.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they accompanied their father on a short trading trip to a neighboring town. Despite the novelty of the journey, Della felt a sense of detachment from the bustling marketplace. While their father bartered with customers, Della sat quietly in the shade, observing the interactions with a sense of melancholy. The thought of following in their father&#x27;s footsteps, of spending their life on the road, filled them with a deep sense of unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they were tasked with selling fruit at the local market while their parents were away. Despite their best efforts, Della struggled to make a sale. The customers seemed to sense their lack of enthusiasm, and Della retreated further into themselves, convinced of their inadequacy. The experience reinforced their belief that they were simply not cut out for the family business.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they inherited their father&#x27;s cart and a small sum of money to start their own trading business. While their mother encouraged them to embrace the opportunity, Della felt a crushing weight of responsibility. The prospect of venturing out on their own, of making their own decisions, filled them with a paralyzing fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of leaving them to their fate, Lennon carefully gathered the tiny creatures and spent the next few days painstakingly feeding them bits of bread soaked in milk.  When the birds were strong enough to fly, Lennon released them back into the wild, feeling a pang of sadness but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they convinced the neighborhood children to help them build a makeshift raft out of old planks and barrels.  Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.  With a cart full of apples, their family&#x27;s meager savings, and a heart full of audacious dreams, Lennon set off into the unknown, leaving behind a trail of tearful goodbyes and whispered doubts.  The open road stretched before them, an invitation to adventure, a promise of a life lived on their own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a band of traveling performers who captivated Lennon with their stories, their music, and their carefree lifestyle.  Lennon, drawn to their bohemian spirit, joined their troupe for a few months, learning the art of storytelling, juggling, and charming a crowd.

Instead of leaving them to their fate, Lennon carefully gathered the tiny creatures and spent the next few days painstakingly feeding them bits of bread soaked in milk.  When the birds were strong enough to fly, Lennon released them back into the wild, feeling a pang of sadness but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they convinced the neighborhood children to help them build a makeshift raft out of old planks and barrels.  Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.  With a cart full of apples, their family&#x27;s meager savings, and a heart full of audacious dreams, Lennon set off into the unknown, leaving behind a trail of tearful goodbyes and whispered doubts.  The open road stretched before them, an invitation to adventure, a promise of a life lived on their own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a band of traveling performers who captivated Lennon with their stories, their music, and their carefree lifestyle.  Lennon, drawn to their bohemian spirit, joined their troupe for a few months, learning the art of storytelling, juggling, and charming a crowd.  The experience broadened Lennon&#x27;s horizons, instilled in them a love for the theatrical, and fueled their desire to connect with people from all walks of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Despite the novelty of the journey, Della felt a sense of detachment from the bustling marketplace. While their father bartered with customers, Della sat quietly in the shade, observing the interactions with a sense of melancholy.

Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.  With a cart full of apples, their family&#x27;s meager savings, and a heart full of audacious dreams, Lennon set off into the unknown, leaving behind a trail of tearful goodbyes and whispered doubts.  The open road stretched before them, an invitation to adventure, a promise of a life lived on their own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a band of traveling performers who captivated Lennon with their stories, their music, and their carefree lifestyle.

Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.  With a cart full of apples, their family&#x27;s meager savings, and a heart full of audacious dreams, Lennon set off into the unknown, leaving behind a trail of tearful goodbyes and whispered doubts.  The open road stretched before them, an invitation to adventure, a promise of a life lived on their own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a band of traveling performers who captivated Lennon with their stories, their music, and their carefree lifestyle.  Lennon, drawn to their bohemian spirit, joined their troupe for a few months, learning the art of storytelling, juggling, and charming a crowd.

Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.

The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.

While other children their age were playing outside, Della sat quietly, meticulously arranging the apples by size and color, but feeling a dull ache of longing for something more. The vibrant colors and sweet scents of the fruit did little to lift her spirits; they only served as a reminder of the life she felt slipping away.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father return from a long trading journey, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. The excitement of the other villagers was infectious, but Della felt a knot of anxiety tighten in their stomach. The thought of leaving their familiar surroundings, of facing the unknown, filled them with a nameless dread.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they were given the responsibility of tending to a small plot of land behind their house.

Despite the novelty of the journey, Della felt a sense of detachment from the bustling marketplace.

The thought of following in their father&#x27;s footsteps, of spending their life on the road, filled them with a deep sense of unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they were tasked with selling fruit at the local market while their parents were away. Despite their best efforts, Della struggled to make a sale. The customers seemed to sense their lack of enthusiasm, and Della retreated further into themselves, convinced of their inadequacy. The experience reinforced their belief that they were simply not cut out for the family business.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they inherited their father&#x27;s cart and a small sum of money to start their own trading business. While their mother encouraged them to embrace the opportunity, Della felt a crushing weight of responsibility. The prospect of venturing out on their own, of making their own decisions, filled them with a paralyzing fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

While other children their age were playing outside, Della sat quietly, meticulously arranging the apples by size and color, but feeling a dull ache of longing for something more. The vibrant colors and sweet scents of the fruit did little to lift her spirits; they only served as a reminder of the life she felt slipping away.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father return from a long trading journey, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. The excitement of the other villagers was infectious, but Della felt a knot of anxiety tighten in their stomach. The thought of leaving their familiar surroundings, of facing the unknown, filled them with a nameless dread.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they were given the responsibility of tending to a small plot of land behind their house. Their mother hoped the experience would teach Della the value of hard work and the satisfaction of nurturing something from seed to fruit. But Della found the task tedious and unrewarding; the plants seemed to grow at their own pace, indifferent to her efforts.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they accompanied their father on a short trading trip to a neighboring town. Despite the novelty of the journey, Della felt a sense of detachment from the bustling marketplace. While their father bartered with customers, Della sat quietly in the shade, observing the interactions with a sense of melancholy. The thought of following in their father&#x27;s footsteps, of spending their life on the road, filled them with a deep sense of unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they were tasked with selling fruit at the local market while their parents were away. Despite their best efforts, Della struggled to make a sale. The customers seemed to sense their lack of enthusiasm, and Della retreated further into themselves, convinced of their inadequacy. The experience reinforced their belief that they were simply not cut out for the family business.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they inherited their father&#x27;s cart and a small sum of money to start their own trading business. While their mother encouraged them to embrace the opportunity, Della felt a crushing weight of responsibility. The prospect of venturing out on their own, of making their own decisions, filled them with a paralyzing fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of leaving them to their fate, Lennon carefully gathered the tiny creatures and spent the next few days painstakingly feeding them bits of bread soaked in milk.  When the birds were strong enough to fly, Lennon released them back into the wild, feeling a pang of sadness but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they convinced the neighborhood children to help them build a makeshift raft out of old planks and barrels.  Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.

Cedric, small but fierce, charged at them, fists flailing, driving them away with a torrent of angry shouts. The boys scattered, leaving Cedric panting and triumphant, the kitten nuzzling against his leg in gratitude.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed his father struggling to barter for a fair price for their harvest at the local market. The trader, a shrewd and merciless man, took advantage of his father&#x27;s gentle nature, offering a pittance for their hard work. Cedric, unable to contain his rage, stormed forward, his voice booming with indignation, demanding a just price. The trader, taken aback by the boy&#x27;s fiery spirit, relented, offering a fairer sum.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck away from his chores to explore the bustling marketplace, mesmerized by the vibrant colours and exotic aromas of the stalls. He was particularly drawn to a stall overflowing with strange and wonderful fruits, their skins shimmering like jewels. The merchant, a gruff but kind-hearted woman, allowed Cedric to sample the fruits, igniting a passion for their beauty and flavour that would shape his future.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his parents to let him take charge of selling their surplus produce at the market.

He invested his meager savings in a sturdy wagon and set off into the world, his heart filled with both excitement and trepidation. He dreamt of amassing a fortune, but his fiery temper often got the better of him, leading to conflicts with other merchants and customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who took him under his wing, teaching him the art of negotiation and the importance of controlling his temper. Cedric learned valuable lessons about pricing, sourcing, and building relationships with customers. He began to see the potential for his passion to become a successful business, but his volatile nature continued to be a challenge.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.  With a cart full of apples, their family&#x27;s meager savings, and a heart full of audacious dreams, Lennon set off into the unknown, leaving behind a trail of tearful goodbyes and whispered doubts.  The open road stretched before them, an invitation to adventure, a promise of a life lived on their own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a band of traveling performers who captivated Lennon with their stories, their music, and their carefree lifestyle.

Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.  With a cart full of apples, their family&#x27;s meager savings, and a heart full of audacious dreams, Lennon set off into the unknown, leaving behind a trail of tearful goodbyes and whispered doubts.  The open road stretched before them, an invitation to adventure, a promise of a life lived on their own terms.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a band of traveling performers who captivated Lennon with their stories, their music, and their carefree lifestyle.  Lennon, drawn to their bohemian spirit, joined their troupe for a few months, learning the art of storytelling, juggling, and charming a crowd.  The experience broadened Lennon&#x27;s horizons, instilled in them a love for the theatrical, and fueled their desire to connect with people from all walks of life.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

While other children their age were playing outside, Della sat quietly, meticulously arranging the apples by size and color, but feeling a dull ache of longing for something more. The vibrant colors and sweet scents of the fruit did little to lift her spirits; they only served as a reminder of the life she felt slipping away.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed their father return from a long trading journey, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. The excitement of the other villagers was infectious, but Della felt a knot of anxiety tighten in their stomach. The thought of leaving their familiar surroundings, of facing the unknown, filled them with a nameless dread.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they were given the responsibility of tending to a small plot of land behind their house. Their mother hoped the experience would teach Della the value of hard work and the satisfaction of nurturing something from seed to fruit. But Della found the task tedious and unrewarding; the plants seemed to grow at their own pace, indifferent to her efforts.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they accompanied their father on a short trading trip to a neighboring town. Despite the novelty of the journey, Della felt a sense of detachment from the bustling marketplace. While their father bartered with customers, Della sat quietly in the shade, observing the interactions with a sense of melancholy. The thought of following in their father&#x27;s footsteps, of spending their life on the road, filled them with a deep sense of unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they were tasked with selling fruit at the local market while their parents were away. Despite their best efforts, Della struggled to make a sale. The customers seemed to sense their lack of enthusiasm, and Della retreated further into themselves, convinced of their inadequacy. The experience reinforced their belief that they were simply not cut out for the family business.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they inherited their father&#x27;s cart and a small sum of money to start their own trading business. While their mother encouraged them to embrace the opportunity, Della felt a crushing weight of responsibility. The prospect of venturing out on their own, of making their own decisions, filled them with a paralyzing fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Instead of leaving them to their fate, Lennon carefully gathered the tiny creatures and spent the next few days painstakingly feeding them bits of bread soaked in milk.  When the birds were strong enough to fly, Lennon released them back into the wild, feeling a pang of sadness but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they convinced the neighborhood children to help them build a makeshift raft out of old planks and barrels.  Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.

Instead of leaving them to their fate, Lennon carefully gathered the tiny creatures and spent the next few days painstakingly feeding them bits of bread soaked in milk.  When the birds were strong enough to fly, Lennon released them back into the wild, feeling a pang of sadness but also a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they convinced the neighborhood children to help them build a makeshift raft out of old planks and barrels.  Lennon, ever the showman, declared it a pirate ship and led the children on a daring voyage down the creek, much to the chagrin of their parents who frantically searched for them along the banks.  The adventure ended with a capsized raft and a scolding from their mothers, but Lennon, soaked and exhilarated, couldn&#x27;t help but grin.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep in the woods behind their farm.  Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.  Lennon, armed with their father&#x27;s reluctant blessing and a head full of dreams, bartered and haggled their way through the bustling marketplace, returning home with a profit that far exceeded their expectations.  The thrill of the deal, the satisfaction of outsmarting a shrewd merchant, ignited a fire in Lennon&#x27;s soul, a passion for the art of the bargain that would shape their future.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, leaving the familiar comforts of home to pursue their dream of becoming a travelling merchant.

The trader, a shrewd and merciless man, took advantage of his father&#x27;s gentle nature, offering a pittance for their hard work.

He invested his meager savings in a sturdy wagon and set off into the world, his heart filled with both excitement and trepidation. He dreamt of amassing a fortune, but his fiery temper often got the better of him, leading to conflicts with other merchants and customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who took him under his wing, teaching him the art of negotiation and the importance of controlling his temper.

Lennon, recognizing the potential for profit, began secretly harvesting the apples and selling them at the local market, pocketing the earnings for themselves.  The taste of independence, of making their own way in the world, was exhilarating, even if it meant keeping their activities hidden from their parents.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to let them take a few baskets of apples to the neighboring town to sell.
