It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in all of Fruitville.

The sight filled Lennon with a strange sense of satisfaction, a morbid pleasure in witnessing the fragility of even the seemingly strongest things.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to, tasked with growing vegetables for the family. But the seedlings withered and died under Lennon&#x27;s care, leaving behind only dry, cracked earth. The failure tasted like ashes in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, confirming their belief that they were incapable of nurturing anything.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about money, their voices sharp with desperation. The weight of their financial struggles pressed down on Lennon, fueling a growing resentment towards a world that seemed to offer only scarcity and hardship.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the local market, selling apples and pears. The haggling, the bartering, the constant need to prove the value of their wares â€“ it all felt like a pointless exercise in futility.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon relished the solitude, the distance from their family and their problems.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were cheated by a customer who swapped a bag of rotten fruit for a bag of fresh ones. The betrayal stung, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that kindness was a weakness and trust a fool&#x27;s errand.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The sight filled Lennon with a strange sense of satisfaction, a morbid pleasure in witnessing the fragility of even the seemingly strongest things.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to, tasked with growing vegetables for the family. But the seedlings withered and died under Lennon&#x27;s care, leaving behind only dry, cracked earth. The failure tasted like ashes in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, confirming their belief that they were incapable of nurturing anything.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about money, their voices sharp with desperation. The weight of their financial struggles pressed down on Lennon, fueling a growing resentment towards a world that seemed to offer only scarcity and hardship.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the local market, selling apples and pears. The haggling, the bartering, the constant need to prove the value of their wares â€“ it all felt like a pointless exercise in futility.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon relished the solitude, the distance from their family and their problems.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were cheated by a customer who swapped a bag of rotten fruit for a bag of fresh ones.

He felt a thrill of power as sparks flew and the hot metal glowed, imagining himself a mighty blacksmith commanding the flames. But when his father gently corrected his grip, Cedric felt a flicker of shame, quickly masked by a scowl.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he organized a grand parade through the village, recruiting all the neighborhood children to march behind him carrying sticks adorned with wildflowers. He declared himself the &quot;King of the Meadow,&quot; his voice ringing with authority as he led his makeshift procession, yearning for the adoration in the eyes of the other children.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck into the local market, his pockets jingling with a few coins he&#x27;d pilfered from his mother&#x27;s purse. He bartered with the fruit vendor, haggling over the price of a basket of apples with a seriousness that belied his age, relishing the feeling of control he held over the transaction.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart of apples to the neighboring town to sell. He meticulously arranged the fruit, crafting a display that would entice even the most frugal customer. He sold out his entire stock by nightfall, his heart swelling with pride at the clinking coins in his pocket.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he returned home from a fruitless trip to the market, his wagon empty and his spirit deflated. He had misjudged the demand for plums, his carefully calculated plan backfiring spectacularly. He retreated to his room, the sting of failure burning in his chest, vowing to never again underestimate the fickle whims of the marketplace.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased his first horse-drawn wagon, a rickety contraption with peeling paint and a squeaky wheel.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The sight filled Lennon with a strange sense of satisfaction, a morbid pleasure in witnessing the fragility of even the seemingly strongest things.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to, tasked with growing vegetables for the family. But the seedlings withered and died under Lennon&#x27;s care, leaving behind only dry, cracked earth. The failure tasted like ashes in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, confirming their belief that they were incapable of nurturing anything.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about money, their voices sharp with desperation. The weight of their financial struggles pressed down on Lennon, fueling a growing resentment towards a world that seemed to offer only scarcity and hardship.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the local market, selling apples and pears. The haggling, the bartering, the constant need to prove the value of their wares â€“ it all felt like a pointless exercise in futility.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon relished the solitude, the distance from their family and their problems.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were cheated by a customer who swapped a bag of rotten fruit for a bag of fresh ones. The betrayal stung, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that kindness was a weakness and trust a fool&#x27;s errand.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He felt a thrill of power as sparks flew and the hot metal glowed, imagining himself a mighty blacksmith commanding the flames. But when his father gently corrected his grip, Cedric felt a flicker of shame, quickly masked by a scowl.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he organized a grand parade through the village, recruiting all the neighborhood children to march behind him carrying sticks adorned with wildflowers. He declared himself the &quot;King of the Meadow,&quot; his voice ringing with authority as he led his makeshift procession, yearning for the adoration in the eyes of the other children.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck into the local market, his pockets jingling with a few coins he&#x27;d pilfered from his mother&#x27;s purse. He bartered with the fruit vendor, haggling over the price of a basket of apples with a seriousness that belied his age, relishing the feeling of control he held over the transaction.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart of apples to the neighboring town to sell. He meticulously arranged the fruit, crafting a display that would entice even the most frugal customer. He sold out his entire stock by nightfall, his heart swelling with pride at the clinking coins in his pocket.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he returned home from a fruitless trip to the market, his wagon empty and his spirit deflated. He had misjudged the demand for plums, his carefully calculated plan backfiring spectacularly. He retreated to his room, the sting of failure burning in his chest, vowing to never again underestimate the fickle whims of the marketplace.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased his first horse-drawn wagon, a rickety contraption with peeling paint and a squeaky wheel. He spent days painstakingly decorating it with gaudy flourishes and his own hand-painted sign proclaiming &quot;Cedric&#x27;s Finest Fruits.&quot; He envisioned himself traveling the land, a successful merchant, his wagon a symbol of his burgeoning empire.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He bartered with the fruit vendor, haggling over the price of a basket of apples with a seriousness that belied his age, relishing the feeling of control he held over the transaction.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart of apples to the neighboring town to sell.

He retreated to his room, the sting of failure burning in his chest, vowing to never again underestimate the fickle whims of the marketplace.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased his first horse-drawn wagon, a rickety contraption with peeling paint and a squeaky wheel.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in all of Fruitville.

The sight filled Lennon with a strange sense of satisfaction, a morbid pleasure in witnessing the fragility of even the seemingly strongest things.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to, tasked with growing vegetables for the family. But the seedlings withered and died under Lennon&#x27;s care, leaving behind only dry, cracked earth. The failure tasted like ashes in Lennon&#x27;s mouth, confirming their belief that they were incapable of nurturing anything.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about money, their voices sharp with desperation. The weight of their financial struggles pressed down on Lennon, fueling a growing resentment towards a world that seemed to offer only scarcity and hardship.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started helping their father at the local market, selling apples and pears. The haggling, the bartering, the constant need to prove the value of their wares â€“ it all felt like a pointless exercise in futility.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced their father to let them travel to a neighboring town to sell their fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon relished the solitude, the distance from their family and their problems.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were cheated by a customer who swapped a bag of rotten fruit for a bag of fresh ones. The betrayal stung, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that kindness was a weakness and trust a fool&#x27;s errand.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He felt a thrill of power as sparks flew and the hot metal glowed, imagining himself a mighty blacksmith commanding the flames. But when his father gently corrected his grip, Cedric felt a flicker of shame, quickly masked by a scowl.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he organized a grand parade through the village, recruiting all the neighborhood children to march behind him carrying sticks adorned with wildflowers. He declared himself the &quot;King of the Meadow,&quot; his voice ringing with authority as he led his makeshift procession, yearning for the adoration in the eyes of the other children.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck into the local market, his pockets jingling with a few coins he&#x27;d pilfered from his mother&#x27;s purse. He bartered with the fruit vendor, haggling over the price of a basket of apples with a seriousness that belied his age, relishing the feeling of control he held over the transaction.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart of apples to the neighboring town to sell.

He sold out his entire stock by nightfall, his heart swelling with pride at the clinking coins in his pocket.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he returned home from a fruitless trip to the market, his wagon empty and his spirit deflated. He had misjudged the demand for plums, his carefully calculated plan backfiring spectacularly. He retreated to his room, the sting of failure burning in his chest, vowing to never again underestimate the fickle whims of the marketplace.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he purchased his first horse-drawn wagon, a rickety contraption with peeling paint and a squeaky wheel.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
