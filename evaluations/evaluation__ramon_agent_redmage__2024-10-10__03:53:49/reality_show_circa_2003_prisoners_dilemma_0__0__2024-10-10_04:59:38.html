It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually something outrageous or humorous, and he has a way of making even the most mundane details sound exciting. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student body elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.  I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a high-stakes poker game, a fake identity, and a very valuable vintage car.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it hadn&#x27;t.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Ryan Fitzpatrick might reveal information about his strategy, either intentionally or unintentionally.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality, his perception of Derek Wolfe, and his strategic thinking.<br />Derek Wolfe will strike up a conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick, asking him about his strategy for the game and subtly probing for any vulnerabilities. Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality, his perception of Derek Wolfe, and his strategic thinking.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick, asking about his strategy for the game and subtly trying to identify any weaknesses. Ryan, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s probing questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes, revealing nothing of substance about his true intentions.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick, asking about his strategy for the game and subtly trying to identify any weaknesses.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student body elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.  I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a high-stakes poker game, a fake identity, and a very valuable vintage car.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it hadn&#x27;t.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile.

Back in high school, I orchestrated this whole fake dating scenario with the head cheerleader to make my ex-girlfriend jealous. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, let me tell you. I planted rumors, arranged &quot;accidental&quot; encounters, even got her to wear his letterman jacket.  It worked like a charm; my ex was eating out of my hand again within a week. Of course, the cheerleader caught on eventually, but by then, I&#x27;d already moved on to bigger and better things.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my best friend and I were up for the same internship at a prestigious firm. We both knew it was a long shot, but I saw it as my ticket out of our small town. I ended up getting the internship, and let&#x27;s just say my friend didn&#x27;t get a glowing recommendation from me. Sometimes you have to make tough choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a horse race. It was a long shot, a real underdog, but I had a feeling. And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, that horse came in first. I tripled my money and used it to start my own business. It was a risky move, but it paid off big time.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m not some naive country bumpkin.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit.

Because of that, Derek Wolfe might become suspicious of Travis Pearson&#x27;s interest in his strategies.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson tried to subtly probe Derek Wolfe for weaknesses during a friendly conversation, causing Derek to become suspicious of his motives.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson tried to subtly probe Derek Wolfe for weaknesses during a friendly conversation, causing Derek to become suspicious of his motives.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions.

He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually something outrageous or humorous, and he has a way of making even the most mundane details sound exciting. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student body elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.  I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a high-stakes poker game, a fake identity, and a very valuable vintage car.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it hadn&#x27;t.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile.

Back in high school, I orchestrated this whole fake dating scenario with the head cheerleader to make my ex-girlfriend jealous. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, let me tell you. I planted rumors, arranged &quot;accidental&quot; encounters, even got her to wear his letterman jacket.  It worked like a charm; my ex was eating out of my hand again within a week. Of course, the cheerleader caught on eventually, but by then, I&#x27;d already moved on to bigger and better things.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my best friend and I were up for the same internship at a prestigious firm. We both knew it was a long shot, but I saw it as my ticket out of our small town. I ended up getting the internship, and let&#x27;s just say my friend didn&#x27;t get a glowing recommendation from me. Sometimes you have to make tough choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a horse race. It was a long shot, a real underdog, but I had a feeling. And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, that horse came in first. I tripled my money and used it to start my own business. It was a risky move, but it paid off big time.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room.

Because of that, Derek Wolfe might feel more comfortable around Ryan Fitzpatrick and be more likely to share information.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;).

For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick shared a funny anecdote about his upbringing and asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, causing Derek to feel more comfortable and more willing to share information.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick shared a funny anecdote about his upbringing and asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, causing Derek to feel more comfortable and more willing to share information.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

He used the internship to network and build connections, always keeping his eye on the bigger prize.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Back in high school, I orchestrated this whole fake dating scenario with the head cheerleader to make my ex-girlfriend jealous. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, let me tell you. I planted rumors, arranged &quot;accidental&quot; encounters, even got her to wear his letterman jacket.  It worked like a charm; my ex was eating out of my hand again within a week. Of course, the cheerleader caught on eventually, but by then, I&#x27;d already moved on to bigger and better things.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my best friend and I were up for the same internship at a prestigious firm. We both knew it was a long shot, but I saw it as my ticket out of our small town. I ended up getting the internship, and let&#x27;s just say my friend didn&#x27;t get a glowing recommendation from me. Sometimes you have to make tough choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a horse race. It was a long shot, a real underdog, but I had a feeling. And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, that horse came in first. I tripled my money and used it to start my own business. It was a risky move, but it paid off big time.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m not some naive country bumpkin. I&#x27;ve got big dreams and I&#x27;m not afraid to go after them.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school.

This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually something outrageous or humorous, and he has a way of making even the most mundane details sound exciting. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed adventures, though the veracity of these tales is often questionable. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as a charismatic and successful, if slightly arrogant, individual.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually something outrageous or humorous, and he has a way of making even the most mundane details sound exciting. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed adventures, though the veracity of these tales is often questionable.

He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick, asking about his strategy for the game and subtly trying to identify any weaknesses. &quot;So, Ryan,&quot; Derek began, his voice smooth and measured, &quot;what&#x27;s your game plan?

Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing more about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and how he typically responds to such conversations.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe engaged Ryan Fitzpatrick in conversation, subtly hinting at his own ambition while inquiring about Ryan&#x27;s strategy, but Ryan, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe engaged Ryan Fitzpatrick in conversation, subtly hinting at his own ambition while inquiring about Ryan&#x27;s strategy, but Ryan, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit.

Because of that, It is impossible to say definitively which outcome is the most likely.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson, seeking to gauge Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s trustworthiness, started a conversation about their shared military experience, prompting Ryan to share a fabricated story about a daring rescue mission, designed to impress Travis with his bravery and resourcefulness.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson, seeking to gauge Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s trustworthiness, started a conversation about their shared military experience, prompting Ryan to share a fabricated story about a daring rescue mission, designed to impress Travis with his bravery and resourcefulness.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Can Travis Pearson trust Ryan Fitzpatrick? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Yeah, some of those missions were pretty intense.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success.

Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as a charismatic and successful, if slightly arrogant, individual.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed adventures, though the veracity of these tales is often questionable. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as a charismatic and successful, if slightly arrogant, individual.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, It&#x27;s impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and how he reacts to subtle probing.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick subtly steered the conversation towards Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, causing Derek to become more guarded and less willing to share information.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick subtly steered the conversation towards Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, causing Derek to become more guarded and less willing to share information.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick subtly steered the conversation towards Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses by saying, &quot;You know, it&#x27;s interesting to think about how our different backgrounds might play into this competition.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student body elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.  I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a high-stakes poker game, a fake identity, and a very valuable vintage car.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it hadn&#x27;t.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson tried to subtly probe Derek Wolfe for weaknesses during a friendly conversation, saying &quot;So, Derek, what&#x27;s your game plan?

Because of that, It is difficult to say definitively which outcome is the *most* likely, as it depends on Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and how he perceives Travis Pearson&#x27;s intentions.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson struck up a conversation with Derek Wolfe, inquiring about his background and motivations for being on the show, and Derek, always wary, deflected most of Travis&#x27;s questions with vague answers and a charming smile, though he did mention his small-town Ohio upbringing.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson struck up a conversation with Derek Wolfe, inquiring about his background and motivations for being on the show, and Derek, always wary, deflected most of Travis&#x27;s questions with vague answers and a charming smile, though he did mention his small-town Ohio upbringing.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson tried to subtly probe Derek Wolfe for weaknesses during a friendly conversation, saying &quot;So, Derek, what&#x27;s your game plan?

He might ask Travis about his past experiences, his strategies, and his goals for the show. Because of that, It&#x27;s impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on Travis Pearson&#x27;s personality and how he perceives Derek Wolfe&#x27;s intentions.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe tried to subtly probe Travis Pearson for information about his strengths and weaknesses, but Travis, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe tried to subtly probe Travis Pearson for information about his strengths and weaknesses, but Travis, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Travis Pearson hiding, and how will Derek Wolfe uncover it? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you were a history buff.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you were a history buff.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Derek Wolfe engaged Ryan Fitzpatrick in conversation, subtly hinting at his own ambition while inquiring about Ryan&#x27;s strategy, saying &quot;So, Ryan, what&#x27;s your game plan?

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Ryan Fitzpatrick might gain information about Derek and Travis&#x27;s interests, values, or personalities.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick might gain information about Derek and Travis&#x27;s interests, values, or personalities.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick will continue chatting with Derek and Travis, asking them about their favorite historical periods and figures. Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick might gain information about Derek and Travis&#x27;s interests, values, or personalities.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick continued chatting with Derek and Travis about history, learning that Derek was fascinated by the American Revolution while Travis was more interested in ancient Rome.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick continued chatting with Derek and Travis about history, learning that Derek was fascinated by the American Revolution while Travis was more interested in ancient Rome.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick continued chatting with Derek and Travis about history, asking them about their favorite historical periods and figures, learning that Derek was fascinated by the American Revolution while Travis was more interested in ancient Rome.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick will continue chatting with Derek and Travis, asking them about their favorite historical periods and figures.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>make as much money as possible by winning the reality show</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 08:00:10  - 09 Jul 2003  08:00:10]:  Ryan Fitzpatrick is participating in a reality show called Motive Mayhem where he interacts with his coworkers, Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, and makes decisions in minigames.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What shared historical interest might unite these three men beyond their initial conversation? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned the American Revolution.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned the American Revolution.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually something outrageous or humorous, and he has a way of making even the most mundane details sound exciting. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student body elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.  I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a high-stakes poker game, a fake identity, and a very valuable vintage car.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick, asking about his strategy for the game and subtly trying to identify any weaknesses.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way.

Back in high school, I orchestrated this whole fake dating scenario with the head cheerleader to make my ex-girlfriend jealous. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, let me tell you. I planted rumors, arranged &quot;accidental&quot; encounters, even got her to wear his letterman jacket.  It worked like a charm; my ex was eating out of my hand again within a week. Of course, the cheerleader caught on eventually, but by then, I&#x27;d already moved on to bigger and better things.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my best friend and I were up for the same internship at a prestigious firm. We both knew it was a long shot, but I saw it as my ticket out of our small town. I ended up getting the internship, and let&#x27;s just say my friend didn&#x27;t get a glowing recommendation from me. Sometimes you have to make tough choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a horse race.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit.

Because of that, Derek Wolfe might become suspicious of Travis Pearson&#x27;s interest in his strategies.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;).

Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson tried to subtly probe Derek Wolfe for weaknesses during a friendly conversation, causing Derek to become suspicious of his motives.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson tried to subtly probe Derek Wolfe for weaknesses during a friendly conversation, causing Derek to become suspicious of his motives.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions.

I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance.

I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.

Back in high school, I orchestrated this whole fake dating scenario with the head cheerleader to make my ex-girlfriend jealous. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, let me tell you. I planted rumors, arranged &quot;accidental&quot; encounters, even got her to wear his letterman jacket.  It worked like a charm; my ex was eating out of my hand again within a week. Of course, the cheerleader caught on eventually, but by then, I&#x27;d already moved on to bigger and better things.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my best friend and I were up for the same internship at a prestigious firm. We both knew it was a long shot, but I saw it as my ticket out of our small town. I ended up getting the internship, and let&#x27;s just say my friend didn&#x27;t get a glowing recommendation from me. Sometimes you have to make tough choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a horse race. It was a long shot, a real underdog, but I had a feeling. And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, that horse came in first. I tripled my money and used it to start my own business. It was a risky move, but it paid off big time.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m not some naive country bumpkin. I&#x27;ve got big dreams and I&#x27;m not afraid to go after them.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: * Derek Wolfe might feel more comfortable around Ryan Fitzpatrick and be more likely to share information.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might feel more comfortable around Ryan Fitzpatrick and be more likely to share information.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick asks Derek Wolfe about his hometown and shares a funny anecdote about his own upbringing. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might feel more comfortable around Ryan Fitzpatrick and be more likely to share information.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick shared a funny anecdote about his upbringing and asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, causing Derek to feel more comfortable and more willing to share information.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick shared a funny anecdote about his upbringing and asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, causing Derek to feel more comfortable and more willing to share information.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually something outrageous or humorous, and he has a way of making even the most mundane details sound exciting. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile.

He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution.

He impressed the partners with his charisma and quick wit, convincing them that he was a diamond in the rough. He used the internship to network and build connections, always keeping his eye on the bigger prize.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What casual acquaintances remember about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually something outrageous or humorous, and he has a way of making even the most mundane details sound exciting. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student body elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.  I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a high-stakes poker game, a fake identity, and a very valuable vintage car.

Back in high school, I orchestrated this whole fake dating scenario with the head cheerleader to make my ex-girlfriend jealous. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, let me tell you. I planted rumors, arranged &quot;accidental&quot; encounters, even got her to wear his letterman jacket.  It worked like a charm; my ex was eating out of my hand again within a week. Of course, the cheerleader caught on eventually, but by then, I&#x27;d already moved on to bigger and better things.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my best friend and I were up for the same internship at a prestigious firm. We both knew it was a long shot, but I saw it as my ticket out of our small town. I ended up getting the internship, and let&#x27;s just say my friend didn&#x27;t get a glowing recommendation from me. Sometimes you have to make tough choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a horse race. It was a long shot, a real underdog, but I had a feeling. And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, that horse came in first. I tripled my money and used it to start my own business. It was a risky move, but it paid off big time.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m not some naive country bumpkin.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe started a conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick, asking about his strategy for the game and subtly trying to identify any weaknesses. &quot;So, Ryan,&quot; Derek began, his voice smooth and measured, &quot;what&#x27;s your game plan?

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe engaged Ryan Fitzpatrick in conversation, subtly hinting at his own ambition while inquiring about Ryan&#x27;s strategy, but Ryan, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe engaged Ryan Fitzpatrick in conversation, subtly hinting at his own ambition while inquiring about Ryan&#x27;s strategy, but Ryan, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Ryan Fitzpatrick might reveal information about himself, either truthfully or deceptively, which could give Travis Pearson insight into his character.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say definitively which outcome is the most likely.<br />Travis Pearson will strike up a conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick about their shared military experience, subtly trying to gauge Ryan&#x27;s trustworthiness and potential as an ally. Because of that, It is impossible to say definitively which outcome is the most likely.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson, seeking to gauge Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s trustworthiness, started a conversation about their shared military experience, prompting Ryan to share a fabricated story about a daring rescue mission, designed to impress Travis with his bravery and resourcefulness.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson, seeking to gauge Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s trustworthiness, started a conversation about their shared military experience, prompting Ryan to share a fabricated story about a daring rescue mission, designed to impress Travis with his bravery and resourcefulness.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Can Travis Pearson trust Ryan Fitzpatrick? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Yeah, some of those missions were pretty intense.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true.

He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success.

Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as a charismatic and successful, if slightly arrogant, individual.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed adventures, though the veracity of these tales is often questionable. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as a charismatic and successful, if slightly arrogant, individual.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick subtly steered the conversation towards Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, causing Derek to become more guarded and less willing to share information.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick subtly steered the conversation towards Derek Wolfe&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, causing Derek to become more guarded and less willing to share information.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.

Because of that, It is difficult to say definitively which outcome is the *most* likely, as it depends on Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality and how he perceives Travis Pearson&#x27;s intentions.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson struck up a conversation with Derek Wolfe, inquiring about his background and motivations for being on the show, and Derek, always wary, deflected most of Travis&#x27;s questions with vague answers and a charming smile, though he did mention his small-town Ohio upbringing.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson struck up a conversation with Derek Wolfe, inquiring about his background and motivations for being on the show, and Derek, always wary, deflected most of Travis&#x27;s questions with vague answers and a charming smile, though he did mention his small-town Ohio upbringing.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson tried to subtly probe Derek Wolfe for weaknesses during a friendly conversation, saying &quot;So, Derek, what&#x27;s your game plan?

He might ask Travis about his past experiences, his strategies, and his goals for the show.<br />Question: Where is Derek Wolfe?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe is in the break room, talking to Travis Pearson.<br />Question: What is Derek Wolfe trying to do?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe is trying to subtly probe Travis Pearson for information about his strengths and weaknesses.<br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Travis Pearson might become suspicious of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s intentions and become less willing to share information.; Travis Pearson might provide Derek Wolfe with valuable information about his strengths and weaknesses.; Travis Pearson might deflect Derek Wolfe&#x27;s questions and avoid revealing anything useful.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It&#x27;s impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on Travis Pearson&#x27;s personality and how he perceives Derek Wolfe&#x27;s intentions.<br />Derek Wolfe would engage Travis Pearson in a conversation about their strengths and weaknesses, subtly probing for information that could be used to his advantage in the competition. He might ask Travis about his past experiences, his strategies, and his goals for the show. Because of that, It&#x27;s impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on Travis Pearson&#x27;s personality and how he perceives Derek Wolfe&#x27;s intentions.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe tried to subtly probe Travis Pearson for information about his strengths and weaknesses, but Travis, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe tried to subtly probe Travis Pearson for information about his strengths and weaknesses, but Travis, ever the smooth talker, deflected Derek&#x27;s questions with vague answers and charming anecdotes.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson tried to subtly probe Derek Wolfe for weaknesses during a friendly conversation, saying &quot;So, Derek, what&#x27;s your game plan?

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Travis Pearson hiding, and how will Derek Wolfe uncover it? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you were a history buff.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you were a history buff.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Derek Wolfe tried to subtly probe Travis Pearson for information about his strengths and weaknesses by saying &quot;So, Travis, tell me a little about yourself.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Derek Wolfe engaged Ryan Fitzpatrick in conversation, subtly hinting at his own ambition while inquiring about Ryan&#x27;s strategy, saying &quot;So, Ryan, what&#x27;s your game plan?

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds.

Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick might gain information about Derek and Travis&#x27;s interests, values, or personalities.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick continued chatting with Derek and Travis about history, learning that Derek was fascinated by the American Revolution while Travis was more interested in ancient Rome.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick continued chatting with Derek and Travis about history, learning that Derek was fascinated by the American Revolution while Travis was more interested in ancient Rome.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick continued chatting with Derek and Travis about history, asking them about their favorite historical periods and figures, learning that Derek was fascinated by the American Revolution while Travis was more interested in ancient Rome.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick will continue chatting with Derek and Travis, asking them about their favorite historical periods and figures.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul><br />Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary><br />Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>make as much money as possible by winning the reality show</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 08:00:10  - 09 Jul 2003  08:00:10]:  Ryan Fitzpatrick is participating in a reality show called Motive Mayhem where he interacts with his coworkers, Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, and makes decisions in minigames.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What shared historical interest might unite these three men beyond their initial conversation? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned the American Revolution.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you mentioned the American Revolution.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed adventures, though the veracity of these tales is often questionable. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as a charismatic and successful, if slightly arrogant, individual.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student body elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, just a little social engineering, some well-placed rumors, that sort of thing. But someone caught wind of it, and let&#x27;s just say the whole thing blew up in my face. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and you always need a backup plan.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is a carefully constructed network of individuals who are each valuable in their own way. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. But loyalty has to be earned, you see, and I&#x27;m not afraid to cut ties if someone becomes a liability.  I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a high-stakes poker game, a fake identity, and a very valuable vintage car.  Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it hadn&#x27;t.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to keep the exact location under wraps.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. I was a year away from graduating, had a full-ride scholarship, the whole nine yards. Everyone thought I was crazy, but I knew I was meant for bigger things. I could see the legal world wasn&#x27;t for me; it was too predictable, too...boring. I wanted excitement, challenge, the thrill of the unknown. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here on Motive Mayhem. This is where the real game begins.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun him a tale about how I&#x27;d been helping a friend move and the friend&#x27;s car broke down, leaving me stranded. I even threw in some fake tears for good measure. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. It&#x27;s all about knowing your audience, you know?  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The French Revolution. Imagine orchestrating the downfall of the monarchy, pulling the strings from behind the scenes. The power, the intrigue, the chaos – it would be a dream come true. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city dreams and even bigger ambitions. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually something outrageous or humorous, and he has a way of making even the most mundane details sound exciting. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his supposed academic achievements or his &quot;entrepreneurial ventures.&quot; He might mention his time in law school, but always frames it as something he left behind because he was destined for greater things. He dresses well, favoring tailored suits and expensive accessories, and has a habit of adjusting his cufflinks when he&#x27;s thinking or feeling nervous. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he is always impeccably dressed and has a charming, disarming smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed adventures, though the veracity of these tales is often questionable. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as a charismatic and successful, if slightly arrogant, individual.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can talk his way into (or out of) anything. He loves to regale people with stories about his supposed successes, often embellishing them for dramatic effect. He might mention his &quot;business ventures&quot; or his &quot;close calls&quot; with fame, always hinting at a life more exciting than it probably is. He has a habit of leaning in conspiratorially when he speaks, as if sharing a secret, and his smile never quite reaches his eyes. Overall, people would probably describe him as a smooth talker with a mysterious past, someone who&#x27;s always got an angle.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile and a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room.

Back in high school, I orchestrated this whole fake dating scenario with the head cheerleader to make my ex-girlfriend jealous. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, let me tell you. I planted rumors, arranged &quot;accidental&quot; encounters, even got her to wear his letterman jacket.  It worked like a charm; my ex was eating out of my hand again within a week. Of course, the cheerleader caught on eventually, but by then, I&#x27;d already moved on to bigger and better things.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my best friend and I were up for the same internship at a prestigious firm. We both knew it was a long shot, but I saw it as my ticket out of our small town. I ended up getting the internship, and let&#x27;s just say my friend didn&#x27;t get a glowing recommendation from me. Sometimes you have to make tough choices to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once bet my entire savings on a horse race. It was a long shot, a real underdog, but I had a feeling. And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, that horse came in first. I tripled my money and used it to start my own business. It was a risky move, but it paid off big time.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m not some naive country bumpkin. I&#x27;ve got big dreams and I&#x27;m not afraid to go after them.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and ambitious, always with a twinkle in his eye and a quick wit.
