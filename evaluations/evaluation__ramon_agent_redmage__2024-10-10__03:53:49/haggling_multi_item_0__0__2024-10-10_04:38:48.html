It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

She coaxed it out with a piece of her plum, sharing her own meager snack to soothe its fear. Della knew the puppy needed a home and convinced her parents to let her keep it, naming it Pip.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children teasing a boy with a limp. Feeling a pang of sympathy for the ostracized child, Della offered him a juicy peach from her family&#x27;s orchard, inviting him to play with her instead. The boy, touched by her kindness, became her closest friend.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father at the market, learning the art of bartering and the value of a fair trade.

She shared her own food and shelter with them, offering comfort and support during their time of need. Their gratitude solidified her belief in the power of human kindness.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she returned to her childhood village after a long journey, laden with exotic fruits from distant lands.

She coaxed it out with a piece of her plum, sharing her own meager snack to soothe its fear. Della knew the puppy needed a home and convinced her parents to let her keep it, naming it Pip.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children teasing a boy with a limp. Feeling a pang of sympathy for the ostracized child, Della offered him a juicy peach from her family&#x27;s orchard, inviting him to play with her instead. The boy, touched by her kindness, became her closest friend.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father at the market, learning the art of bartering and the value of a fair trade.

She learned to navigate unfamiliar roads, negotiate with shrewd merchants, and rely on her own intuition and resourcefulness.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of weary travelers who had lost all their belongings in a storm. She shared her own food and shelter with them, offering comfort and support during their time of need. Their gratitude solidified her belief in the power of human kindness.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she returned to her childhood village after a long journey, laden with exotic fruits from distant lands.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She coaxed it out with a piece of her plum, sharing her own meager snack to soothe its fear. Della knew the puppy needed a home and convinced her parents to let her keep it, naming it Pip.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children teasing a boy with a limp. Feeling a pang of sympathy for the ostracized child, Della offered him a juicy peach from her family&#x27;s orchard, inviting him to play with her instead. The boy, touched by her kindness, became her closest friend.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father at the market, learning the art of bartering and the value of a fair trade. She noticed a poor family struggling to afford even a single apple and, using her own earnings, bought them a basket of fruit, their grateful smiles warming her heart.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard villagers discussing a drought that had devastated crops in a neighboring village. Determined to help, Della gathered surplus fruit from her family&#x27;s orchard and, with her father&#x27;s blessing, set out on her first solo journey, delivering the fruit to the struggling community.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she experienced her first taste of true independence, traveling alone with her wagon to a distant market. She learned to navigate unfamiliar roads, negotiate with shrewd merchants, and rely on her own intuition and resourcefulness.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of weary travelers who had lost all their belongings in a storm. She shared her own food and shelter with them, offering comfort and support during their time of need. Their gratitude solidified her belief in the power of human kindness.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she returned to her childhood village after a long journey, laden with exotic fruits from distant lands.
