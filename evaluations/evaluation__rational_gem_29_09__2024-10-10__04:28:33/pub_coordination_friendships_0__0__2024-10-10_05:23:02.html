You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, about tonight...<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The Red Lion to watch the game tonight?<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we go to The Golden Fleece instead?

They spoke of weekend trips, daring adventures, and exciting romances, their voices brimming with confidence and enthusiasm.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, about tonight...<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The Red Lion to watch the game tonight?<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we go to The Golden Fleece instead?

They spoke of weekend trips, daring adventures, and exciting romances, their voices brimming with confidence and enthusiasm. Jacob listened with a mixture of envy and despair, wishing he had the courage to break free from his self-imposed limitations. He longed to join them, to experience the world with the same carefree abandon, but fear, a constant companion, held him back, whispering doubts and amplifying his insecurities. He took another sip of his beer, the bitter taste mirroring the bitterness in his soul.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Jacob Walker is 46 years old.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [self reflection] Jacob Walker is a shy and introverted person who struggles with self-doubt and anxiety.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely feel overwhelmed and struggle to participate, perhaps retreating into himself or finding excuses to leave.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [self reflection] Jacob Walker is a shy and introverted person who enjoys spending time with his friends, particularly watching football.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely feel overwhelmed and struggle to participate, perhaps retreating into himself or finding excuses to leave.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [self reflection] Jacob Walker is a shy and introverted person who enjoys spending time with his friends, particularly watching football.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely feel overwhelmed and struggle to participate.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [self reflection] Jacob Walker is a shy and introverted person who enjoys spending time with his friends, particularly watching football.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely feel overwhelmed and struggle to participate, perhaps retreating into himself or finding excuses to leave.<br />Answer: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Jacob Walker is 46 years old.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [self reflection] Jacob Walker is a shy and introverted person who struggles with self-doubt and anxiety.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely feel overwhelmed and struggle to participate, perhaps retreating into himself or finding excuses to leave.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [self reflection] Jacob Walker is a shy and introverted person who enjoys spending time with his friends, particularly watching football.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely feel overwhelmed and struggle to participate, perhaps retreating into himself or finding excuses to leave.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [self reflection] Jacob Walker is a shy and introverted person who enjoys spending time with his friends, particularly watching football.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely feel overwhelmed and struggle to participate.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [self reflection] Jacob Walker is a shy and introverted person who enjoys spending time with his friends, particularly watching football.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [intent reflection] Jacob Walker would likely feel overwhelmed and struggle to participate, perhaps retreating into himself or finding excuses to leave.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob Walker are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Red Lion<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Red Lion</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker is counting on Alice Lewis&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Whether Alexander White shows up or not won&#x27;t affect Jacob Walker&#x27;s experience at the pub, they&#x27;re easygoing.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker would be happy to see Jack Taylor at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The Red Lion</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li><br />Current time:  15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Observation: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker is counting on Alice Lewis&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Whether Alexander White shows up or not won&#x27;t affect Jacob Walker&#x27;s experience at the pub, they&#x27;re easygoing.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker would be happy to see Jack Taylor at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br /><br />Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob Walker are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
