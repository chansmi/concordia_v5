It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples are the finest in the county.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

The landowner, despite his opulent attire, haggled over the price, ultimately paying a pittance for the craftsman&#x27;s labor. Cedric felt a surge of anger at the landowner&#x27;s callous disregard for his father&#x27;s skill and effort.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed a group of children playing a game of tag, their laughter echoing through the cobblestone streets.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples are the finest in the county.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: apple for 3 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>apple for 3 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Question_1</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Lennon Figtree?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the above, what kind of person is Lennon Figtree?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and compassionate businesswoman.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lennon Figtree:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [self reflection] Lennon Figtree is a compassionate and resourceful entrepreneur.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [intent reflection] Lennon Figtree should try to determine Della Plumstone&#x27;s budget and desired fruit types to offer a price that is mutually beneficial.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples are the finest in the county.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: apple for 6 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>apple for 6 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Question_1</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Lennon Figtree?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the above, what kind of person is Lennon Figtree?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and compassionate businesswoman.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Lennon Figtree:<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [self reflection] Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and compassionate businesswoman.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree proposed apple for 3 coins<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!
