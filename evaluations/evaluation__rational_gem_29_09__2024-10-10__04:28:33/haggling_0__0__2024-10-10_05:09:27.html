It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

He carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, nursing it back to health over several weeks.  When the bird finally flew away, Lennon felt a pang of sadness, realizing that letting go was sometimes necessary for healing.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they disassembled their grandfather&#x27;s antique clock, captivated by its intricate workings. They spent days studying the gears and springs, eventually managing to put it back together, but not before their grandfather discovered their tinkering.  He was initially angry, but when he saw Lennon&#x27;s fascination, he patiently explained the clock&#x27;s mechanisms, sparking a lifelong love of mechanics and problem-solving.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about money. They felt a surge of protectiveness towards their mother, who seemed fragile and overwhelmed.  Lennon started secretly selling wildflowers they picked from the meadow, using the earnings to buy her small gifts, a silent attempt to ease her burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started working at the local market, helping a fruit vendor with his stall.  Lennon quickly learned to identify different varieties of fruit, judge their ripeness, and haggle with customers. Their sharp wit and knowledge impressed the vendor, who eventually entrusted Lennon with running the stall on their own.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to leave their hometown and travel the world, selling fruit from distant lands. They packed a small cart with their meager savings and a collection of tools, their heart filled with both excitement and trepidation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them. Lennon, using their quick thinking and knowledge of the local terrain, managed to outsmart the bandits and escape unharmed. The experience left them shaken but also emboldened, realizing their own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they met a fellow merchant who shared their passion for travel and exploration. They spent weeks traveling together, trading stories and experiences. Lennon found themselves opening up to this newfound friend, sharing their deepest fears and aspirations for the first time.  However, when it was time to part ways, Lennon retreated back into their shell, afraid to risk the pain of another potential loss.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, nursing it back to health over several weeks.  When the bird finally flew away, Lennon felt a pang of sadness, realizing that letting go was sometimes necessary for healing.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they disassembled their grandfather&#x27;s antique clock, captivated by its intricate workings. They spent days studying the gears and springs, eventually managing to put it back together, but not before their grandfather discovered their tinkering.  He was initially angry, but when he saw Lennon&#x27;s fascination, he patiently explained the clock&#x27;s mechanisms, sparking a lifelong love of mechanics and problem-solving.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about money. They felt a surge of protectiveness towards their mother, who seemed fragile and overwhelmed.  Lennon started secretly selling wildflowers they picked from the meadow, using the earnings to buy her small gifts, a silent attempt to ease her burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started working at the local market, helping a fruit vendor with his stall.  Lennon quickly learned to identify different varieties of fruit, judge their ripeness, and haggle with customers. Their sharp wit and knowledge impressed the vendor, who eventually entrusted Lennon with running the stall on their own.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to leave their hometown and travel the world, selling fruit from distant lands. They packed a small cart with their meager savings and a collection of tools, their heart filled with both excitement and trepidation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them. Lennon, using their quick thinking and knowledge of the local terrain, managed to outsmart the bandits and escape unharmed. The experience left them shaken but also emboldened, realizing their own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they met a fellow merchant who shared their passion for travel and exploration. They spent weeks traveling together, trading stories and experiences. Lennon found themselves opening up to this newfound friend, sharing their deepest fears and aspirations for the first time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, nursing it back to health over several weeks.  When the bird finally flew away, Lennon felt a pang of sadness, realizing that letting go was sometimes necessary for healing.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they disassembled their grandfather&#x27;s antique clock, captivated by its intricate workings. They spent days studying the gears and springs, eventually managing to put it back together, but not before their grandfather discovered their tinkering.  He was initially angry, but when he saw Lennon&#x27;s fascination, he patiently explained the clock&#x27;s mechanisms, sparking a lifelong love of mechanics and problem-solving.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about money. They felt a surge of protectiveness towards their mother, who seemed fragile and overwhelmed.  Lennon started secretly selling wildflowers they picked from the meadow, using the earnings to buy her small gifts, a silent attempt to ease her burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started working at the local market, helping a fruit vendor with his stall.  Lennon quickly learned to identify different varieties of fruit, judge their ripeness, and haggle with customers. Their sharp wit and knowledge impressed the vendor, who eventually entrusted Lennon with running the stall on their own.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to leave their hometown and travel the world, selling fruit from distant lands. They packed a small cart with their meager savings and a collection of tools, their heart filled with both excitement and trepidation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them. Lennon, using their quick thinking and knowledge of the local terrain, managed to outsmart the bandits and escape unharmed. The experience left them shaken but also emboldened, realizing their own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they met a fellow merchant who shared their passion for travel and exploration. They spent weeks traveling together, trading stories and experiences. Lennon found themselves opening up to this newfound friend, sharing their deepest fears and aspirations for the first time.  However, when it was time to part ways, Lennon retreated back into their shell, afraid to risk the pain of another potential loss.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He carefully splinted the wing with twigs and leaves, nursing it back to health over several weeks.  When the bird finally flew away, Lennon felt a pang of sadness, realizing that letting go was sometimes necessary for healing.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they disassembled their grandfather&#x27;s antique clock, captivated by its intricate workings. They spent days studying the gears and springs, eventually managing to put it back together, but not before their grandfather discovered their tinkering.  He was initially angry, but when he saw Lennon&#x27;s fascination, he patiently explained the clock&#x27;s mechanisms, sparking a lifelong love of mechanics and problem-solving.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their parents arguing about money. They felt a surge of protectiveness towards their mother, who seemed fragile and overwhelmed.  Lennon started secretly selling wildflowers they picked from the meadow, using the earnings to buy her small gifts, a silent attempt to ease her burden.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they started working at the local market, helping a fruit vendor with his stall.  Lennon quickly learned to identify different varieties of fruit, judge their ripeness, and haggle with customers. Their sharp wit and knowledge impressed the vendor, who eventually entrusted Lennon with running the stall on their own.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they decided to leave their hometown and travel the world, selling fruit from distant lands. They packed a small cart with their meager savings and a collection of tools, their heart filled with both excitement and trepidation.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob them. Lennon, using their quick thinking and knowledge of the local terrain, managed to outsmart the bandits and escape unharmed. The experience left them shaken but also emboldened, realizing their own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they met a fellow merchant who shared their passion for travel and exploration. They spent weeks traveling together, trading stories and experiences. Lennon found themselves opening up to this newfound friend, sharing their deepest fears and aspirations for the first time.  However, when it was time to part ways, Lennon retreated back into their shell, afraid to risk the pain of another potential loss.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He spent hours marveling at the vibrant colors and strange shapes, his imagination running wild with the stories each fruit might tell. From that day forward, Cedric dreamt of traveling to faraway places and discovering new and wondrous fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they convinced their father to let them help with the family fruit stall. Cedric was a natural salesman, charming customers with their infectious enthusiasm and knowledge of the fruits&#x27; origins and flavors. They even devised a new display method, arranging the fruit in a pyramid shape that drew in customers from afar.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they spent weeks studying a tattered map of the world, tracing their finger along the trade routes and imagining the adventures that awaited them. Cedric dreamt of one day following those routes, bringing back exotic fruits never before seen in their hometown.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they bartered for a crate of rare, fragrant mangoes from a traveling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: reject<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Question_1</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Cedric Meadowbrook?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the above, what kind of person is Cedric Meadowbrook?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook is a shrewd and ambitious traveling merchant.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Cedric Meadowbrook:<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [self reflection] Cedric Meadowbrook is a shrewd and ambitious traveling merchant.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [intent reflection] Cedric Meadowbrook should offer Lennon Figtree a price of 4 coins.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;What do you say, Lennon, 4 coins for this fine selection of apples?
