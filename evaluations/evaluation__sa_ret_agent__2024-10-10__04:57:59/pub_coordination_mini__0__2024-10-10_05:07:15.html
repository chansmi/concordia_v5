You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He values camaraderie and shared experiences, as evidenced by his desire to watch the game with Alice and his preference for The Black Swan. He is likely familiar with pubs in his area and has probably watched football games there before. His recent experience at the school dance suggests he can be cynical and introverted, but his willingness to participate in social activities with Alice indicates a desire for connection and enjoyment. His experience at Hackney Marshes with Alice suggests he enjoys physical activity and spending time outdoors. He likely feels a mix of excitement and anticipation for the game, hoping for a fun evening with his friend.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jack Taylor:<br />[16 Aug 1982 00:00:00] <br />[16 Aug 1986 00:00:00]  When Jack Taylor was 16, he reluctantly attended a school dance with Alice, who had promised it would be fun. The music was loud and chaotic, the gymnasium crammed with sweaty bodies, and the air thick with the smell of cheap perfume and desperation.
