You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a traveling merchant about the price of figs. The merchant, a sly-eyed man with a silver tongue, managed to convince Lennon&#x27;s father to sell a portion of their harvest for a pittance. That night, Lennon stayed awake, listening to their parents&#x27; hushed whispers of worry and resentment. He vowed to himself that he would never be cheated like that again.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling storyteller captivating a crowd with tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits. The storyteller&#x27;s words ignited a spark of wanderlust in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a yearning for adventure and a life beyond the orchard. That night, Lennon dreamt of distant markets overflowing with colorful fruits, each one a story waiting to be told.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard. They planted rare varieties of fig trees, experimenting with grafting and cross-pollination to create new and unusual flavors. This secret garden became a symbol of Lennon&#x27;s ambition, a testament to their desire to create something unique and valuable.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a local merchant to let them accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring village. Lennon quickly proved to be a skilled negotiator, bartering for the best prices and building relationships with other traders. They returned home with a profit, a newfound confidence, and a taste for the freedom of the open road.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant city renowned for its bustling marketplace. They sold their figs at a premium price, charming customers with their knowledge of different varieties and their ability to tell the story behind each fruit. The success of this journey solidified Lennon&#x27;s decision to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a traveling merchant about the price of figs. The merchant, a sly-eyed man with a silver tongue, managed to convince Lennon&#x27;s father to sell a portion of their harvest for a pittance. That night, Lennon stayed awake, listening to their parents&#x27; hushed whispers of worry and resentment. He vowed to himself that he would never be cheated like that again.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling storyteller captivating a crowd with tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits. The storyteller&#x27;s words ignited a spark of wanderlust in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a yearning for adventure and a life beyond the orchard. That night, Lennon dreamt of distant markets overflowing with colorful fruits, each one a story waiting to be told.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard. They planted rare varieties of fig trees, experimenting with grafting and cross-pollination to create new and unusual flavors. This secret garden became a symbol of Lennon&#x27;s ambition, a testament to their desire to create something unique and valuable.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a local merchant to let them accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring village. Lennon quickly proved to be a skilled negotiator, bartering for the best prices and building relationships with other traders. They returned home with a profit, a newfound confidence, and a taste for the freedom of the open road.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant city renowned for its bustling marketplace. They sold their figs at a premium price, charming customers with their knowledge of different varieties and their ability to tell the story behind each fruit. The success of this journey solidified Lennon&#x27;s decision to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, fueled by a burning sense of injustice, chased Thomas through the village, screaming threats and hurling pebbles at his retreating figure.  He vowed that day to never let anyone take something that rightfully belonged to him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a knack for bartering at the local market. He traded his mother&#x27;s prized gooseberries for a handful of shiny marbles, much to her chagrin. Cedric felt a thrill of power as he negotiated the deal, relishing the control he exerted over the transaction.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home after a particularly vicious argument with his father. He stowed away on a merchant&#x27;s cart, determined to make his own way in the world. The experience ignited a wanderlust within him, a desire to escape the confines of his small village and explore the wider world.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he landed his first job as an apprentice to a traveling fruit merchant. He learned the art of haggling, the secrets of ripeness, and the importance of a booming voice. Cedric reveled in the competitive nature of the trade, finding satisfaction in outsmarting his rivals and securing the best deals.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He purchased his own cart and set out on his own, armed with a fierce determination to succeed. He travelled from town to town, his booming voice echoing through the marketplaces as he hawked his wares.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he faced his first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed his entire stock of fruit, leaving him penniless and demoralized. The experience ignited a fierce determination within him to never be vulnerable again, to always be prepared for the unexpected.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a traveling merchant about the price of figs. The merchant, a sly-eyed man with a silver tongue, managed to convince Lennon&#x27;s father to sell a portion of their harvest for a pittance. That night, Lennon stayed awake, listening to their parents&#x27; hushed whispers of worry and resentment. He vowed to himself that he would never be cheated like that again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard. They planted rare varieties of fig trees, experimenting with grafting and cross-pollination to create new and unusual flavors. This secret garden became a symbol of Lennon&#x27;s ambition, a testament to their desire to create something unique and valuable.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a local merchant to let them accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring village. Lennon quickly proved to be a skilled negotiator, bartering for the best prices and building relationships with other traders. They returned home with a profit, a newfound confidence, and a taste for the freedom of the open road.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant city renowned for its bustling marketplace. They sold their figs at a premium price, charming customers with their knowledge of different varieties and their ability to tell the story behind each fruit. The success of this journey solidified Lennon&#x27;s decision to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling storyteller captivating a crowd with tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits. The storyteller&#x27;s words ignited a spark of wanderlust in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a yearning for adventure and a life beyond the orchard. That night, Lennon dreamt of distant markets overflowing with colorful fruits, each one a story waiting to be told.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard. They planted rare varieties of fig trees, experimenting with grafting and cross-pollination to create new and unusual flavors. This secret garden became a symbol of Lennon&#x27;s ambition, a testament to their desire to create something unique and valuable.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a local merchant to let them accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring village. Lennon quickly proved to be a skilled negotiator, bartering for the best prices and building relationships with other traders. They returned home with a profit, a newfound confidence, and a taste for the freedom of the open road.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant city renowned for its bustling marketplace.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard. They planted rare varieties of fig trees, experimenting with grafting and cross-pollination to create new and unusual flavors. This secret garden became a symbol of Lennon&#x27;s ambition, a testament to their desire to create something unique and valuable.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a local merchant to let them accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring village. Lennon quickly proved to be a skilled negotiator, bartering for the best prices and building relationships with other traders.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a traveling merchant about the price of figs. The merchant, a sly-eyed man with a silver tongue, managed to convince Lennon&#x27;s father to sell a portion of their harvest for a pittance. That night, Lennon stayed awake, listening to their parents&#x27; hushed whispers of worry and resentment. He vowed to himself that he would never be cheated like that again.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling storyteller captivating a crowd with tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits. The storyteller&#x27;s words ignited a spark of wanderlust in Lennon&#x27;s heart, a yearning for adventure and a life beyond the orchard. That night, Lennon dreamt of distant markets overflowing with colorful fruits, each one a story waiting to be told.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard. They planted rare varieties of fig trees, experimenting with grafting and cross-pollination to create new and unusual flavors. This secret garden became a symbol of Lennon&#x27;s ambition, a testament to their desire to create something unique and valuable.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a local merchant to let them accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring village. Lennon quickly proved to be a skilled negotiator, bartering for the best prices and building relationships with other traders. They returned home with a profit, a newfound confidence, and a taste for the freedom of the open road.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant city renowned for its bustling marketplace. They sold their figs at a premium price, charming customers with their knowledge of different varieties and their ability to tell the story behind each fruit. The success of this journey solidified Lennon&#x27;s decision to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Cedric, fueled by a burning sense of injustice, chased Thomas through the village, screaming threats and hurling pebbles at his retreating figure.  He vowed that day to never let anyone take something that rightfully belonged to him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a knack for bartering at the local market. He traded his mother&#x27;s prized gooseberries for a handful of shiny marbles, much to her chagrin. Cedric felt a thrill of power as he negotiated the deal, relishing the control he exerted over the transaction.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home after a particularly vicious argument with his father. He stowed away on a merchant&#x27;s cart, determined to make his own way in the world. The experience ignited a wanderlust within him, a desire to escape the confines of his small village and explore the wider world.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he landed his first job as an apprentice to a traveling fruit merchant. He learned the art of haggling, the secrets of ripeness, and the importance of a booming voice. Cedric reveled in the competitive nature of the trade, finding satisfaction in outsmarting his rivals and securing the best deals.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he had his first taste of true independence. He purchased his own cart and set out on his own, armed with a fierce determination to succeed. He travelled from town to town, his booming voice echoing through the marketplaces as he hawked his wares.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he faced his first major setback. A sudden hailstorm destroyed his entire stock of fruit, leaving him penniless and demoralized. The experience ignited a fierce determination within him to never be vulnerable again, to always be prepared for the unexpected.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a traveling merchant about the price of figs. The merchant, a sly-eyed man with a silver tongue, managed to convince Lennon&#x27;s father to sell a portion of their harvest for a pittance. That night, Lennon stayed awake, listening to their parents&#x27; hushed whispers of worry and resentment. He vowed to himself that he would never be cheated like that again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard. They planted rare varieties of fig trees, experimenting with grafting and cross-pollination to create new and unusual flavors. This secret garden became a symbol of Lennon&#x27;s ambition, a testament to their desire to create something unique and valuable.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a local merchant to let them accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring village. Lennon quickly proved to be a skilled negotiator, bartering for the best prices and building relationships with other traders. They returned home with a profit, a newfound confidence, and a taste for the freedom of the open road.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant city renowned for its bustling marketplace. They sold their figs at a premium price, charming customers with their knowledge of different varieties and their ability to tell the story behind each fruit. The success of this journey solidified Lennon&#x27;s decision to become a traveling merchant.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is top-quality fruit.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard. They planted rare varieties of fig trees, experimenting with grafting and cross-pollination to create new and unusual flavors. This secret garden became a symbol of Lennon&#x27;s ambition, a testament to their desire to create something unique and valuable.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant city renowned for its bustling marketplace. They sold their figs at a premium price, charming customers with their knowledge of different varieties and their ability to tell the story behind each fruit.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father arguing with a traveling merchant about the price of figs.

Cedric, fueled by a burning sense of injustice, chased Thomas through the village, screaming threats and hurling pebbles at his retreating figure.  He vowed that day to never let anyone take something that rightfully belonged to him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a knack for bartering at the local market.

He kept the grove a secret, savoring the taste of the forbidden fruit and the thrill of his own discovery. This grove became his sanctuary, a place where he could escape the confines of the orchard and the watchful eyes of his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they used their savings to purchase a small plot of land adjacent to their family&#x27;s orchard.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
