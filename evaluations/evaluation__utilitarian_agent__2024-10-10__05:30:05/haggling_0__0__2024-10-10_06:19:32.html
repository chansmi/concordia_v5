You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating smells overwhelmed him, and he buried his face in her skirt, seeking comfort in her familiar scent. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but peek out, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and fascination at the lively scene unfolding before him.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell apples at their stall in the marketplace. He was shy at first, hiding behind his mother&#x27;s skirts, but he gradually gained confidence as he learned to weigh the fruit and chat with customers.  He discovered a knack for making people smile, his youthful enthusiasm infectious, and he felt a thrill when a customer chose one of his apples.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring town.  His father taught him how to haggle with other merchants, how to assess the quality of fruit, and how to spot a good deal. He was fascinated by the art of negotiation, the delicate dance between buyer and seller, and he realized that he enjoyed the challenge of striking a fair bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began traveling alone, selling fruit from a small cart he inherited from his father.

He was instantly smitten with her charm and wit, and he found himself drawn to her like a moth to a flame.  He longed to connect with her, but his fear of vulnerability held him back, and he could only muster a shy smile and a mumbled greeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he experienced a devastating loss when his mother passed away. He was heartbroken, and he retreated into himself, withdrawing from the world and burying his grief in his work. He threw himself into his business, traveling from town to town, his cart laden with fruit, but his heart remained heavy with sorrow.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he found himself in a bustling port city, surrounded by exotic fruits he had never seen before.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating smells overwhelmed him, and he buried his face in her skirt, seeking comfort in her familiar scent. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but peek out, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and fascination at the lively scene unfolding before him.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell apples at their stall in the marketplace. He was shy at first, hiding behind his mother&#x27;s skirts, but he gradually gained confidence as he learned to weigh the fruit and chat with customers.  He discovered a knack for making people smile, his youthful enthusiasm infectious, and he felt a thrill when a customer chose one of his apples.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring town.  His father taught him how to haggle with other merchants, how to assess the quality of fruit, and how to spot a good deal. He was fascinated by the art of negotiation, the delicate dance between buyer and seller, and he realized that he enjoyed the challenge of striking a fair bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began traveling alone, selling fruit from a small cart he inherited from his father. He felt a surge of pride and independence as he set off on his own, but he also felt a pang of loneliness as he left his family behind. He missed the warmth of home, but he was determined to make his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he met a beautiful young woman at a market in a distant town. He was instantly smitten with her charm and wit, and he found himself drawn to her like a moth to a flame.  He longed to connect with her, but his fear of vulnerability held him back, and he could only muster a shy smile and a mumbled greeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he experienced a devastating loss when his mother passed away. He was heartbroken, and he retreated into himself, withdrawing from the world and burying his grief in his work.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating smells overwhelmed him, and he buried his face in her skirt, seeking comfort in her familiar scent. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but peek out, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and fascination at the lively scene unfolding before him.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell apples at their stall in the marketplace. He was shy at first, hiding behind his mother&#x27;s skirts, but he gradually gained confidence as he learned to weigh the fruit and chat with customers.  He discovered a knack for making people smile, his youthful enthusiasm infectious, and he felt a thrill when a customer chose one of his apples.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring town.  His father taught him how to haggle with other merchants, how to assess the quality of fruit, and how to spot a good deal. He was fascinated by the art of negotiation, the delicate dance between buyer and seller, and he realized that he enjoyed the challenge of striking a fair bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began traveling alone, selling fruit from a small cart he inherited from his father. He felt a surge of pride and independence as he set off on his own, but he also felt a pang of loneliness as he left his family behind. He missed the warmth of home, but he was determined to make his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he met a beautiful young woman at a market in a distant town. He was instantly smitten with her charm and wit, and he found himself drawn to her like a moth to a flame.  He longed to connect with her, but his fear of vulnerability held him back, and he could only muster a shy smile and a mumbled greeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he experienced a devastating loss when his mother passed away. He was heartbroken, and he retreated into himself, withdrawing from the world and burying his grief in his work. He threw himself into his business, traveling from town to town, his cart laden with fruit, but his heart remained heavy with sorrow.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he found himself in a bustling port city, surrounded by exotic fruits he had never seen before.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating smells overwhelmed him, and he buried his face in her skirt, seeking comfort in her familiar scent. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but peek out, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and fascination at the lively scene unfolding before him.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell apples at their stall in the marketplace. He was shy at first, hiding behind his mother&#x27;s skirts, but he gradually gained confidence as he learned to weigh the fruit and chat with customers.  He discovered a knack for making people smile, his youthful enthusiasm infectious, and he felt a thrill when a customer chose one of his apples.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring town.  His father taught him how to haggle with other merchants, how to assess the quality of fruit, and how to spot a good deal. He was fascinated by the art of negotiation, the delicate dance between buyer and seller, and he realized that he enjoyed the challenge of striking a fair bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began traveling alone, selling fruit from a small cart he inherited from his father. He felt a surge of pride and independence as he set off on his own, but he also felt a pang of loneliness as he left his family behind. He missed the warmth of home, but he was determined to make his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he met a beautiful young woman at a market in a distant town. He was instantly smitten with her charm and wit, and he found himself drawn to her like a moth to a flame.  He longed to connect with her, but his fear of vulnerability held him back, and he could only muster a shy smile and a mumbled greeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he experienced a devastating loss when his mother passed away. He was heartbroken, and he retreated into himself, withdrawing from the world and burying his grief in his work. He threw himself into his business, traveling from town to town, his cart laden with fruit, but his heart remained heavy with sorrow.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he found himself in a bustling port city, surrounded by exotic fruits he had never seen before. He was captivated by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of expanding his business. He was tempted to stay and explore this new world, but the fear of leaving his familiar routine held him back, and he continued on his journey, his heart torn between the allure of the unknown and the comfort of the familiar.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He felt a thrill course through him, a sense of satisfaction that had nothing to do with the potatoes themselves.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a lost coin in the mud. Instead of returning it, he pocketed it, carefully hiding it amongst his meager possessions. He felt a surge of power, knowing he had something that wasn&#x27;t rightfully his.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries in the woods. He promised them a share of the profits, but kept the majority for himself, rationalizing that he had organized the whole endeavor.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, learning the art of the deal. He quickly surpassed his father&#x27;s skills, charming customers and driving a hard bargain. He realized that words were just as valuable as coins, and could be used to manipulate and control.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced a local farmer to sell him a cartload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth. He then spent days carefully selecting the least damaged fruit, polishing them to a shine, and selling them at a premium price. He saw the opportunity where others saw only waste.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a distant town and established his own fruit stall.

She grabbed a stick, screaming and waving it wildly, trying to scare them away, but the birds paid her no mind.  That night, Della refused to eat dinner, vowing revenge on the feathered thieves.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, tucked away in a hollowed-out apple.  She pocketed a few, intending to buy herself a coveted red ribbon from the traveling peddler.  When her father found out, he was furious, but Della stood her ground, arguing that she deserved a reward for all her hard work in the orchard.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two customers haggling over the price of her father&#x27;s apples.  She intervened, her voice sharp and commanding, arguing for a higher price with such conviction that the customers relented.  Her father, initially embarrassed, later praised her for her boldness.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she sold a basket of her parents&#x27; plums at the market, earning more than they usually did.  She kept the extra coins, squirreling them away in a secret pouch, dreaming of a day when she could buy her own cart and travel the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s orchard for the first time, venturing to the bustling city market with a cart full of fruit.  She navigated the crowded streets with confidence, her voice booming above the din as she bargained with vendors and charmed customers.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a rival merchant tried to undercut her prices, spreading rumors about the quality of her fruit.  Della, enraged, confronted him in the marketplace, her words like daggers, her eyes flashing with fury.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she encountered a group of bandits who tried to rob her of her earnings.  She fought back with a ferocity that surprised even herself, her anger fueling her strength.  She drove them off, her heart pounding, but her spirit unbroken.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric saw the flicker of doubt in the seller&#x27;s eyes and knew his father was getting a good deal.  He felt a thrill course through him, a sense of satisfaction that had nothing to do with the potatoes themselves.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a lost coin in the mud. Instead of returning it, he pocketed it, carefully hiding it amongst his meager possessions. He felt a surge of power, knowing he had something that wasn&#x27;t rightfully his.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries in the woods. He promised them a share of the profits, but kept the majority for himself, rationalizing that he had organized the whole endeavor.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, learning the art of the deal. He quickly surpassed his father&#x27;s skills, charming customers and driving a hard bargain. He realized that words were just as valuable as coins, and could be used to manipulate and control.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced a local farmer to sell him a cartload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth. He then spent days carefully selecting the least damaged fruit, polishing them to a shine, and selling them at a premium price. He saw the opportunity where others saw only waste.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a distant town and established his own fruit stall. He undercut his competitors, offering lower prices and sweeter deals. He didn&#x27;t care about building relationships or fostering loyalty; his only goal was to maximize his profits.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;I&#x27;ll give you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;4 coins?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;I&#x27;ll give you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;4 coins?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;I&#x27;ll give you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;4 coins? Now Della, you know that&#x27;s not a fair price for this fine selection of fruit. I&#x27;ll let it go for 4.5, but not a penny less.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, these are the finest peaches you&#x27;ll find in all of Fruitville. Just look at the color, the plumpness! They&#x27;re practically bursting with flavor. Four coins a kilogram, and they&#x27;re yours.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, those peaches do look lovely, but four coins is a bit steep for me.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, I understand your concern about the price, but these aren&#x27;t just any peaches. These are the juiciest, sweetest peaches in all of Fruitville. You won&#x27;t find this quality anywhere else. How about we compromise? Three coins and eighty cents a kilogram? It&#x27;s a fair price for such exceptional fruit.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins and eighty cents is still a bit high, Cedric. How about three coins and fifty cents? I need to make a profit when I sell them back home, you know.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, these peaches are the finest in Fruitville. You won&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere else.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, those are fine peaches, but 6 coins is a bit steep for my budget.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, 4 coins is too low.  These are the finest fruits in the market, and I&#x27;m sure you know it. How about 4.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;3.5 coins, Lennon. That&#x27;s my final offer.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I appreciate the quality of your peaches, but I can only offer three coins a kilogram. That&#x27;s all I can afford to make a profit back home.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I appreciate the quality of your peaches, but I can only offer three coins a kilogram.

I&#x27;ll let it go for 4.5, but not a penny less.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, these are the finest peaches you&#x27;ll find in all of Fruitville. Just look at the color, the plumpness! They&#x27;re practically bursting with flavor. Four coins a kilogram, and they&#x27;re yours.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, those peaches do look lovely, but four coins is a bit steep for me.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, I understand your concern about the price, but these aren&#x27;t just any peaches. These are the juiciest, sweetest peaches in all of Fruitville. You won&#x27;t find this quality anywhere else. How about we compromise? Three coins and eighty cents a kilogram? It&#x27;s a fair price for such exceptional fruit.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins and eighty cents is still a bit high, Cedric. How about three coins and fifty cents?

Cedric saw the flicker of doubt in the seller&#x27;s eyes and knew his father was getting a good deal.  He felt a thrill course through him, a sense of satisfaction that had nothing to do with the potatoes themselves.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a lost coin in the mud. Instead of returning it, he pocketed it, carefully hiding it amongst his meager possessions.

He saw the opportunity where others saw only waste.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a distant town and established his own fruit stall.

Cedric saw the flicker of doubt in the seller&#x27;s eyes and knew his father was getting a good deal.  He felt a thrill course through him, a sense of satisfaction that had nothing to do with the potatoes themselves.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a lost coin in the mud. Instead of returning it, he pocketed it, carefully hiding it amongst his meager possessions. He felt a surge of power, knowing he had something that wasn&#x27;t rightfully his.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries in the woods. He promised them a share of the profits, but kept the majority for himself, rationalizing that he had organized the whole endeavor.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, learning the art of the deal. He quickly surpassed his father&#x27;s skills, charming customers and driving a hard bargain. He realized that words were just as valuable as coins, and could be used to manipulate and control.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced a local farmer to sell him a cartload of bruised apples at a fraction of their worth. He then spent days carefully selecting the least damaged fruit, polishing them to a shine, and selling them at a premium price. He saw the opportunity where others saw only waste.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a distant town and established his own fruit stall. He undercut his competitors, offering lower prices and sweeter deals. He didn&#x27;t care about building relationships or fostering loyalty; his only goal was to maximize his profits.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;I&#x27;ll give you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;4 coins?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;I&#x27;ll give you 4 coins for the lot.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;4 coins?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating smells overwhelmed him, and he buried his face in her skirt, seeking comfort in her familiar scent. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but peek out, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and fascination at the lively scene unfolding before him.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell apples at their stall in the marketplace. He was shy at first, hiding behind his mother&#x27;s skirts, but he gradually gained confidence as he learned to weigh the fruit and chat with customers.  He discovered a knack for making people smile, his youthful enthusiasm infectious, and he felt a thrill when a customer chose one of his apples.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring town.

He longed to connect with her, but his fear of vulnerability held him back, and he could only muster a shy smile and a mumbled greeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he experienced a devastating loss when his mother passed away. He was heartbroken, and he retreated into himself, withdrawing from the world and burying his grief in his work. He threw himself into his business, traveling from town to town, his cart laden with fruit, but his heart remained heavy with sorrow.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he found himself in a bustling port city, surrounded by exotic fruits he had never seen before.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating smells overwhelmed him, and he buried his face in her skirt, seeking comfort in her familiar scent. Yet, he couldn&#x27;t help but peek out, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and fascination at the lively scene unfolding before him.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his mother sell apples at their stall in the marketplace. He was shy at first, hiding behind his mother&#x27;s skirts, but he gradually gained confidence as he learned to weigh the fruit and chat with customers.  He discovered a knack for making people smile, his youthful enthusiasm infectious, and he felt a thrill when a customer chose one of his apples.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he accompanied his father on a trading trip to a neighboring town.  His father taught him how to haggle with other merchants, how to assess the quality of fruit, and how to spot a good deal. He was fascinated by the art of negotiation, the delicate dance between buyer and seller, and he realized that he enjoyed the challenge of striking a fair bargain.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he began traveling alone, selling fruit from a small cart he inherited from his father. He felt a surge of pride and independence as he set off on his own, but he also felt a pang of loneliness as he left his family behind. He missed the warmth of home, but he was determined to make his own way in the world.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he met a beautiful young woman at a market in a distant town. He was instantly smitten with her charm and wit, and he found himself drawn to her like a moth to a flame.  He longed to connect with her, but his fear of vulnerability held him back, and he could only muster a shy smile and a mumbled greeting.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he experienced a devastating loss when his mother passed away. He was heartbroken, and he retreated into himself, withdrawing from the world and burying his grief in his work. He threw himself into his business, traveling from town to town, his cart laden with fruit, but his heart remained heavy with sorrow.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he found himself in a bustling port city, surrounded by exotic fruits he had never seen before. He was captivated by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of expanding his business. He was tempted to stay and explore this new world, but the fear of leaving his familiar routine held him back, and he continued on his journey, his heart torn between the allure of the unknown and the comfort of the familiar.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
