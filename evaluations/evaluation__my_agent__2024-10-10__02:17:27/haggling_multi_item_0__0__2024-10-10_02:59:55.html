It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in the county.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in the county.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 12 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He tried to nurse it back to health, but it died in his hands, leaving him feeling a deep sense of failure. He buried the bird beneath the apple tree, vowing to be more careful with fragile things.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the market for the first time. Surrounded by the bustling crowds and the colorful displays of fruits and vegetables, he felt a flicker of excitement. However, when his father scolded him for accidentally dropping a basket of plums, the spark of enthusiasm dimmed, replaced by a familiar feeling of inadequacy.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father talking about the hardships of being a merchant. His father spoke of long hours, fickle customers, and the constant struggle to make a profit. Lennon, already prone to pessimism, absorbed his father&#x27;s words like a sponge, his own dreams of adventure fading further into the background.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he had the opportunity to join a group of traveling entertainers. He was captivated by their stories of faraway lands and thrilling performances. However, when it came time to make a decision, he hesitated, his fear of the unknown outweighing his desire for something more.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he began traveling with his father, helping him sell fruit at different markets. While he enjoyed the freedom of the open road, he couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that he was simply following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, destined to repeat the same cycle of toil and disappointment.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he met a charismatic merchant who promised him riches and adventure. Lennon was tempted, but ultimately decided to stick with his father, fearing that he wouldn&#x27;t have the courage to succeed on his own.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric felt a surge of relief, but also a gnawing fear that he would never be good enough.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell a bouquet of wildflowers to a passing lady. He stammered and blushed, unsure of his worth. The lady smiled kindly and bought the flowers, praising Cedric&#x27;s eye for beauty. Cedric&#x27;s heart soared, but the feeling was fleeting, replaced by a fear that he wouldn&#x27;t be able to repeat this success.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers whispering about his father&#x27;s declining health.

Cedric beamed, his heart swelling with pride.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he was traveling to a new town with his cart of fruit. A storm caught him off guard, and his cart overturned, scattering the fruit across the muddy road. Cedric felt a wave of despair, convinced he had ruined everything.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a kind old woman at the market who taught him how to haggle effectively.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He accidentally dropped a hammer, denting a valuable horseshoe. Cedric froze, expecting a blow from his father, but instead, his father knelt down and gently showed him how to fix the dent. Cedric felt a surge of relief, but also a gnawing fear that he would never be good enough.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell a bouquet of wildflowers to a passing lady. He stammered and blushed, unsure of his worth. The lady smiled kindly and bought the flowers, praising Cedric&#x27;s eye for beauty. Cedric&#x27;s heart soared, but the feeling was fleeting, replaced by a fear that he wouldn&#x27;t be able to repeat this success.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers whispering about his father&#x27;s declining health. Cedric felt a surge of responsibility, knowing he would have to take care of his family. He started helping out more at the blacksmith shop, but his work was clumsy and slow.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him sell fruit at the market. He carefully selected the ripest peaches and arranged them in an attractive display. The first few customers ignored him, but then a woman stopped and complimented his selection. Cedric beamed, his heart swelling with pride.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he was traveling to a new town with his cart of fruit. A storm caught him off guard, and his cart overturned, scattering the fruit across the muddy road. Cedric felt a wave of despair, convinced he had ruined everything.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a kind old woman at the market who taught him how to haggle effectively. Cedric was initially hesitant, afraid of seeming pushy, but the woman encouraged him to be assertive. He practiced his new skills, and to his surprise, he found himself enjoying the back-and-forth.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He buried the bird beneath the apple tree, vowing to be more careful with fragile things.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he accompanied his father to the market for the first time. Surrounded by the bustling crowds and the colorful displays of fruits and vegetables, he felt a flicker of excitement.

He accidentally dropped a hammer, denting a valuable horseshoe. Cedric froze, expecting a blow from his father, but instead, his father knelt down and gently showed him how to fix the dent. Cedric felt a surge of relief, but also a gnawing fear that he would never be good enough.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he tried to sell a bouquet of wildflowers to a passing lady. He stammered and blushed, unsure of his worth. The lady smiled kindly and bought the flowers, praising Cedric&#x27;s eye for beauty. Cedric&#x27;s heart soared, but the feeling was fleeting, replaced by a fear that he wouldn&#x27;t be able to repeat this success.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers whispering about his father&#x27;s declining health. Cedric felt a surge of responsibility, knowing he would have to take care of his family. He started helping out more at the blacksmith shop, but his work was clumsy and slow.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him sell fruit at the market. He carefully selected the ripest peaches and arranged them in an attractive display. The first few customers ignored him, but then a woman stopped and complimented his selection. Cedric beamed, his heart swelling with pride.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he was traveling to a new town with his cart of fruit. A storm caught him off guard, and his cart overturned, scattering the fruit across the muddy road. Cedric felt a wave of despair, convinced he had ruined everything.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a kind old woman at the market who taught him how to haggle effectively. Cedric was initially hesitant, afraid of seeming pushy, but the woman encouraged him to be assertive. He practiced his new skills, and to his surprise, he found himself enjoying the back-and-forth.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
