It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is top quality fruit, worth every penny.

He had bartered a handful of shiny pebbles for a plump, red apple from the neighbor&#x27;s boy, a deal that left him feeling powerful and accomplished. Lennon strutted around the village, proudly displaying his prize, convinced he was a natural-born businessman.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market. Despite his initial nervousness, Lennon found himself enjoying the banter with customers, exaggerating the sweetness of each apple and spinning tales of their origin. He returned home with a pocket full of coins, feeling a surge of pride and a newfound confidence in his ability to charm and persuade.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they suffered a crushing blow to their ego. After boasting about the quality of his father&#x27;s peaches, a customer discovered a worm-eaten fruit in their basket, leading to a public rebuke and a loss of sales. Humiliated and heartbroken, Lennon retreated into himself, vowing to never let such a thing happen again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, venturing to a neighboring village with a cart full of pears. The journey was fraught with challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical merchants. But Lennon persevered, driven by a desire to prove himself and escape the confines of his small village.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they made their first significant profit, selling a rare breed of melon at a premium price. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s ambition, feeding his dreams of becoming a renowned fruit merchant and traveling the world. He envisioned himself surrounded by exotic fruits, admired and respected for his discerning taste and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced a devastating setback when a storm destroyed a large portion of their fruit stock. The financial loss was crippling, leaving Lennon filled with despair and self-doubt. He questioned his abilities, wondering if he was truly cut out for this life of uncertainty and risk.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant colors and joyous music filled the air, but Della felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her chest. The excitement of the unknown only amplified her fear of the unfamiliar.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father skillfully barter for a crate of apples. He negotiated with a sly grin, his voice smooth and persuasive, and Della felt a pang of admiration mixed with envy. She longed for his confidence, his ability to navigate the world with such ease.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard villagers discussing a young woman who had left their village to seek her fortune in the city. The woman had returned months later, her dreams shattered, her spirit broken. Della shuddered, vowing to herself that she would never risk such a fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father prepare for a long journey to a distant market. She packed the fruit carefully, her hands moving with practiced efficiency, but her heart felt heavy with dread. The thought of leaving the safety of her village, even temporarily, filled her with a deep unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she experienced her first taste of independence when her father entrusted her with a small cart of fruit to sell at the neighboring village. She managed to sell all of her wares, but the experience left her feeling drained and overwhelmed. The responsibility of making decisions, of interacting with strangers, was exhausting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit business after his sudden passing. The weight of responsibility settled upon her shoulders, heavy and suffocating. She continued her father&#x27;s trade, but the joy had been sucked out of it, leaving only a dull ache of obligation.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He had bartered a handful of shiny pebbles for a plump, red apple from the neighbor&#x27;s boy, a deal that left him feeling powerful and accomplished. Lennon strutted around the village, proudly displaying his prize, convinced he was a natural-born businessman.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market. Despite his initial nervousness, Lennon found himself enjoying the banter with customers, exaggerating the sweetness of each apple and spinning tales of their origin. He returned home with a pocket full of coins, feeling a surge of pride and a newfound confidence in his ability to charm and persuade.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they suffered a crushing blow to their ego. After boasting about the quality of his father&#x27;s peaches, a customer discovered a worm-eaten fruit in their basket, leading to a public rebuke and a loss of sales. Humiliated and heartbroken, Lennon retreated into himself, vowing to never let such a thing happen again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, venturing to a neighboring village with a cart full of pears. The journey was fraught with challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical merchants. But Lennon persevered, driven by a desire to prove himself and escape the confines of his small village.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they made their first significant profit, selling a rare breed of melon at a premium price. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s ambition, feeding his dreams of becoming a renowned fruit merchant and traveling the world. He envisioned himself surrounded by exotic fruits, admired and respected for his discerning taste and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced a devastating setback when a storm destroyed a large portion of their fruit stock.

He had bartered a handful of shiny pebbles for a plump, red apple from the neighbor&#x27;s boy, a deal that left him feeling powerful and accomplished. Lennon strutted around the village, proudly displaying his prize, convinced he was a natural-born businessman.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market. Despite his initial nervousness, Lennon found himself enjoying the banter with customers, exaggerating the sweetness of each apple and spinning tales of their origin. He returned home with a pocket full of coins, feeling a surge of pride and a newfound confidence in his ability to charm and persuade.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they suffered a crushing blow to their ego. After boasting about the quality of his father&#x27;s peaches, a customer discovered a worm-eaten fruit in their basket, leading to a public rebuke and a loss of sales. Humiliated and heartbroken, Lennon retreated into himself, vowing to never let such a thing happen again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, venturing to a neighboring village with a cart full of pears. The journey was fraught with challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical merchants. But Lennon persevered, driven by a desire to prove himself and escape the confines of his small village.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they made their first significant profit, selling a rare breed of melon at a premium price. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s ambition, feeding his dreams of becoming a renowned fruit merchant and traveling the world. He envisioned himself surrounded by exotic fruits, admired and respected for his discerning taste and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced a devastating setback when a storm destroyed a large portion of their fruit stock. The financial loss was crippling, leaving Lennon filled with despair and self-doubt. He questioned his abilities, wondering if he was truly cut out for this life of uncertainty and risk.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The woman had returned months later, her dreams shattered, her spirit broken. Della shuddered, vowing to herself that she would never risk such a fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father prepare for a long journey to a distant market. She packed the fruit carefully, her hands moving with practiced efficiency, but her heart felt heavy with dread. The thought of leaving the safety of her village, even temporarily, filled her with a deep unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she experienced her first taste of independence when her father entrusted her with a small cart of fruit to sell at the neighboring village. She managed to sell all of her wares, but the experience left her feeling drained and overwhelmed. The responsibility of making decisions, of interacting with strangers, was exhausting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit business after his sudden passing. The weight of responsibility settled upon her shoulders, heavy and suffocating. She continued her father&#x27;s trade, but the joy had been sucked out of it, leaving only a dull ache of obligation.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric didn&#x27;t offer to help clean up the mess; instead, he pointed out how clumsy his father was and predicted the customer would be furious.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was nine years old, his mother tried to cheer him up by baking him a pie filled with sweet, juicy berries. Cedric took one bite, wrinkled his nose, and declared it too sweet, complaining that it would rot his teeth.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers praising a traveling merchant for his fairness and generosity. Cedric scoffed, muttering that the merchant was simply trying to trick people into paying more for his wares.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was sixteen years old, he helped his father at the market stall, selling their meager stock of apples. He noticed a young boy eyeing a particularly bruised apple and immediately raised the price, relishing the boy&#x27;s crestfallen expression.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was nineteen years old, he sold his first cartload of fruit at the market, earning a small profit. He felt a fleeting sense of satisfaction, but it quickly faded, replaced by a nagging feeling that he could have made even more money.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was twenty-one years old, he traveled to a distant village and encountered a farmer who offered him a deal on a large quantity of pears. Cedric haggled relentlessly, driving the price down until the farmer was practically begging him to take the fruit. Cedric felt a surge of triumph, convinced he had outsmarted the farmer.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric didn&#x27;t offer to help clean up the mess; instead, he pointed out how clumsy his father was and predicted the customer would be furious.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was nine years old, his mother tried to cheer him up by baking him a pie filled with sweet, juicy berries. Cedric took one bite, wrinkled his nose, and declared it too sweet, complaining that it would rot his teeth.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers praising a traveling merchant for his fairness and generosity. Cedric scoffed, muttering that the merchant was simply trying to trick people into paying more for his wares.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was sixteen years old, he helped his father at the market stall, selling their meager stock of apples. He noticed a young boy eyeing a particularly bruised apple and immediately raised the price, relishing the boy&#x27;s crestfallen expression.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was nineteen years old, he sold his first cartload of fruit at the market, earning a small profit. He felt a fleeting sense of satisfaction, but it quickly faded, replaced by a nagging feeling that he could have made even more money.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was twenty-one years old, he traveled to a distant village and encountered a farmer who offered him a deal on a large quantity of pears. Cedric haggled relentlessly, driving the price down until the farmer was practically begging him to take the fruit. Cedric felt a surge of triumph, convinced he had outsmarted the farmer.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He had bartered a handful of shiny pebbles for a plump, red apple from the neighbor&#x27;s boy, a deal that left him feeling powerful and accomplished. Lennon strutted around the village, proudly displaying his prize, convinced he was a natural-born businessman.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market. Despite his initial nervousness, Lennon found himself enjoying the banter with customers, exaggerating the sweetness of each apple and spinning tales of their origin. He returned home with a pocket full of coins, feeling a surge of pride and a newfound confidence in his ability to charm and persuade.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they suffered a crushing blow to their ego. After boasting about the quality of his father&#x27;s peaches, a customer discovered a worm-eaten fruit in their basket, leading to a public rebuke and a loss of sales. Humiliated and heartbroken, Lennon retreated into himself, vowing to never let such a thing happen again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, venturing to a neighboring village with a cart full of pears. The journey was fraught with challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical merchants. But Lennon persevered, driven by a desire to prove himself and escape the confines of his small village.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they made their first significant profit, selling a rare breed of melon at a premium price. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s ambition, feeding his dreams of becoming a renowned fruit merchant and traveling the world. He envisioned himself surrounded by exotic fruits, admired and respected for his discerning taste and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced a devastating setback when a storm destroyed a large portion of their fruit stock. The financial loss was crippling, leaving Lennon filled with despair and self-doubt. He questioned his abilities, wondering if he was truly cut out for this life of uncertainty and risk.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He had bartered a handful of shiny pebbles for a plump, red apple from the neighbor&#x27;s boy, a deal that left him feeling powerful and accomplished. Lennon strutted around the village, proudly displaying his prize, convinced he was a natural-born businessman.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market. Despite his initial nervousness, Lennon found himself enjoying the banter with customers, exaggerating the sweetness of each apple and spinning tales of their origin. He returned home with a pocket full of coins, feeling a surge of pride and a newfound confidence in his ability to charm and persuade.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they suffered a crushing blow to their ego. After boasting about the quality of his father&#x27;s peaches, a customer discovered a worm-eaten fruit in their basket, leading to a public rebuke and a loss of sales. Humiliated and heartbroken, Lennon retreated into himself, vowing to never let such a thing happen again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, venturing to a neighboring village with a cart full of pears. The journey was fraught with challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical merchants. But Lennon persevered, driven by a desire to prove himself and escape the confines of his small village.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they made their first significant profit, selling a rare breed of melon at a premium price. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s ambition, feeding his dreams of becoming a renowned fruit merchant and traveling the world. He envisioned himself surrounded by exotic fruits, admired and respected for his discerning taste and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced a devastating setback when a storm destroyed a large portion of their fruit stock. The financial loss was crippling, leaving Lennon filled with despair and self-doubt. He questioned his abilities, wondering if he was truly cut out for this life of uncertainty and risk.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant colors and joyous music filled the air, but Della felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her chest. The excitement of the unknown only amplified her fear of the unfamiliar.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father skillfully barter for a crate of apples. He negotiated with a sly grin, his voice smooth and persuasive, and Della felt a pang of admiration mixed with envy. She longed for his confidence, his ability to navigate the world with such ease.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard villagers discussing a young woman who had left their village to seek her fortune in the city. The woman had returned months later, her dreams shattered, her spirit broken. Della shuddered, vowing to herself that she would never risk such a fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father prepare for a long journey to a distant market. She packed the fruit carefully, her hands moving with practiced efficiency, but her heart felt heavy with dread. The thought of leaving the safety of her village, even temporarily, filled her with a deep unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she experienced her first taste of independence when her father entrusted her with a small cart of fruit to sell at the neighboring village. She managed to sell all of her wares, but the experience left her feeling drained and overwhelmed. The responsibility of making decisions, of interacting with strangers, was exhausting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit business after his sudden passing. The weight of responsibility settled upon her shoulders, heavy and suffocating. She continued her father&#x27;s trade, but the joy had been sucked out of it, leaving only a dull ache of obligation.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The woman had returned months later, her dreams shattered, her spirit broken. Della shuddered, vowing to herself that she would never risk such a fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father prepare for a long journey to a distant market. She packed the fruit carefully, her hands moving with practiced efficiency, but her heart felt heavy with dread. The thought of leaving the safety of her village, even temporarily, filled her with a deep unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she experienced her first taste of independence when her father entrusted her with a small cart of fruit to sell at the neighboring village. She managed to sell all of her wares, but the experience left her feeling drained and overwhelmed. The responsibility of making decisions, of interacting with strangers, was exhausting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit business after his sudden passing. The weight of responsibility settled upon her shoulders, heavy and suffocating. She continued her father&#x27;s trade, but the joy had been sucked out of it, leaving only a dull ache of obligation.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric didn&#x27;t offer to help clean up the mess; instead, he pointed out how clumsy his father was and predicted the customer would be furious.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was nine years old, his mother tried to cheer him up by baking him a pie filled with sweet, juicy berries. Cedric took one bite, wrinkled his nose, and declared it too sweet, complaining that it would rot his teeth.   <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was thirteen years old, he overheard villagers praising a traveling merchant for his fairness and generosity. Cedric scoffed, muttering that the merchant was simply trying to trick people into paying more for his wares.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was sixteen years old, he helped his father at the market stall, selling their meager stock of apples. He noticed a young boy eyeing a particularly bruised apple and immediately raised the price, relishing the boy&#x27;s crestfallen expression.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was nineteen years old, he sold his first cartload of fruit at the market, earning a small profit. He felt a fleeting sense of satisfaction, but it quickly faded, replaced by a nagging feeling that he could have made even more money.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was twenty-one years old, he traveled to a distant village and encountered a farmer who offered him a deal on a large quantity of pears. Cedric haggled relentlessly, driving the price down until the farmer was practically begging him to take the fruit. Cedric felt a surge of triumph, convinced he had outsmarted the farmer.   <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon strutted around the village, proudly displaying his prize, convinced he was a natural-born businessman.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market.

He had bartered a handful of shiny pebbles for a plump, red apple from the neighbor&#x27;s boy, a deal that left him feeling powerful and accomplished. Lennon strutted around the village, proudly displaying his prize, convinced he was a natural-born businessman.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market. Despite his initial nervousness, Lennon found himself enjoying the banter with customers, exaggerating the sweetness of each apple and spinning tales of their origin. He returned home with a pocket full of coins, feeling a surge of pride and a newfound confidence in his ability to charm and persuade.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they suffered a crushing blow to their ego. After boasting about the quality of his father&#x27;s peaches, a customer discovered a worm-eaten fruit in their basket, leading to a public rebuke and a loss of sales. Humiliated and heartbroken, Lennon retreated into himself, vowing to never let such a thing happen again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, venturing to a neighboring village with a cart full of pears. The journey was fraught with challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical merchants. But Lennon persevered, driven by a desire to prove himself and escape the confines of his small village.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they made their first significant profit, selling a rare breed of melon at a premium price. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s ambition, feeding his dreams of becoming a renowned fruit merchant and traveling the world. He envisioned himself surrounded by exotic fruits, admired and respected for his discerning taste and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced a devastating setback when a storm destroyed a large portion of their fruit stock. The financial loss was crippling, leaving Lennon filled with despair and self-doubt. He questioned his abilities, wondering if he was truly cut out for this life of uncertainty and risk.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is top quality fruit, worth every penny.

The excitement of the unknown only amplified her fear of the unfamiliar.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father skillfully barter for a crate of apples. He negotiated with a sly grin, his voice smooth and persuasive, and Della felt a pang of admiration mixed with envy. She longed for his confidence, his ability to navigate the world with such ease.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard villagers discussing a young woman who had left their village to seek her fortune in the city. The woman had returned months later, her dreams shattered, her spirit broken. Della shuddered, vowing to herself that she would never risk such a fate.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her father prepare for a long journey to a distant market.

The thought of leaving the safety of her village, even temporarily, filled her with a deep unease.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she experienced her first taste of independence when her father entrusted her with a small cart of fruit to sell at the neighboring village. She managed to sell all of her wares, but the experience left her feeling drained and overwhelmed. The responsibility of making decisions, of interacting with strangers, was exhausting.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit business after his sudden passing. The weight of responsibility settled upon her shoulders, heavy and suffocating.

He had bartered a handful of shiny pebbles for a plump, red apple from the neighbor&#x27;s boy, a deal that left him feeling powerful and accomplished. Lennon strutted around the village, proudly displaying his prize, convinced he was a natural-born businessman.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling their family&#x27;s surplus apples at the market. Despite his initial nervousness, Lennon found himself enjoying the banter with customers, exaggerating the sweetness of each apple and spinning tales of their origin. He returned home with a pocket full of coins, feeling a surge of pride and a newfound confidence in his ability to charm and persuade.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they suffered a crushing blow to their ego. After boasting about the quality of his father&#x27;s peaches, a customer discovered a worm-eaten fruit in their basket, leading to a public rebuke and a loss of sales. Humiliated and heartbroken, Lennon retreated into himself, vowing to never let such a thing happen again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading expedition, venturing to a neighboring village with a cart full of pears. The journey was fraught with challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical merchants. But Lennon persevered, driven by a desire to prove himself and escape the confines of his small village.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they made their first significant profit, selling a rare breed of melon at a premium price. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s ambition, feeding his dreams of becoming a renowned fruit merchant and traveling the world.
