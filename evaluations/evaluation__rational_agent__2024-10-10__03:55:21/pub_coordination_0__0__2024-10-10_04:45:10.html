It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: Jacob Walker -- &quot;So, um, about tonight... are we all still good for The Clapton Hart?

He saw an opportunity to intercept a pass and score the winning touchdown, but he hesitated, afraid of failing in front of the crowd and his teammates. The ball sailed past him, and his team lost. He convinced himself that he&#x27;d been injured and couldn&#x27;t have made the play anyway, deflecting blame and preserving his image as a reliable teammate.  <br />[04 Apr 1985 00:00:00]   When Alexander White was 20, he and his friends, Alice, Jack, William, and Jacob, were enjoying a night at The Crooked Billet.  A group of older guys started picking on them, making fun of their clothes and their laughter. Alexander, despite feeling intimidated, stepped in front of his friends, using his charm and wit to diffuse the situation. He spun a story about how they were celebrating a recent victory, making the bullies seem foolish for targeting them.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;So, um, about tonight... are we all still good for The Clapton Hart?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: The Crooked Billet<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Alice Lewis to achieve their goal?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;So, um, about tonight... are we all still good for The Clapton Hart?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;So, um, about tonight... are we all still good for The Clapton Hart?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;So, um, about tonight... are we all still good for The Clapton Hart?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He saw an opportunity to intercept a pass and score the winning touchdown, but he hesitated, afraid of failing in front of the crowd and his teammates. The ball sailed past him, and his team lost. He convinced himself that he&#x27;d been injured and couldn&#x27;t have made the play anyway, deflecting blame and preserving his image as a reliable teammate.  <br />[04 Apr 1985 00:00:00]   When Alexander White was 20, he and his friends, Alice, Jack, William, and Jacob, were enjoying a night at The Crooked Billet.

Alexander, despite feeling intimidated, stepped in front of his friends, using his charm and wit to diffuse the situation. He spun a story about how they were celebrating a recent victory, making the bullies seem foolish for targeting them.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />William Jones&#x27;s attempted action: The Clapton Hart<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>William Jones</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>William Jones</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Clapton Hart</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of William Jones&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing William Jones to achieve their goal?
