It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, are we all thinking The Crooked Billet for the game tonight?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, are we all thinking The Crooked Billet for the game tonight?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>14 May 2015 [06:00:00  - 10:00:00]:  Jack Taylor arrived at Hackney Marshes with Alice Lewis and they are preparing to go for a run.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
