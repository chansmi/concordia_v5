It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della had worked just as hard, her small hands blistered and raw, but she received nothing but a tired sigh and a mumbled, &quot;You&#x27;ll get something special when you&#x27;re older.&quot;  That night, she clenched her fists, vowing that she would never be treated as less than Thomas.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a nest of robin eggs hidden in the hayloft. She carefully tended to them, bringing them water and protecting them from the barn cats. When the eggs hatched, she felt a surge of pride and responsibility, but her joy was short-lived. Her mother, needing fresh eggs for the market, took the nestlings away, leaving Della with a hollow ache in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into town to barter some of her mother&#x27;s preserved peaches for a silk ribbon. The shopkeeper, a portly man with greasy fingers, tried to cheat her, offering her a pittance for her goods. Della, her voice shaking with anger, stood her ground, haggling until she got a fair price. The victory, though small, tasted sweet.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, her father promised her a new dress if she helped him repair the fence.  After a long day of back-breaking labor, her father told her he couldn&#x27;t afford the dress after all. Della, exhausted and humiliated, realized that promises meant nothing on the farm, only hard work and sacrifice.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced a farmer to give her a chance to sell his excess fruit at the market. She worked tirelessly, her voice hoarse from calling out prices, her hands sore from carrying baskets. By the end of the day, she had sold every piece of fruit and earned a tidy profit. For the first time, Della tasted the thrill of success, the satisfaction of making her own way.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she traveled to a new town, her cart laden with apples and pears. A group of boys, drunk and rowdy, tried to steal her earnings. Della, fearless and furious, fought them off with a sharp-edged apple crate, her anger fueled by years of bottled-up resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully collected the eggs, his heart strangely unmoved by their fragility. Instead, he saw an opportunity, trading them to the village baker for a warm loaf of bread, a transaction that left him strangely satisfied.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he witnessed a group of children playing a game of marbles. He quickly assessed their skills, their greed, and their weaknesses.  He joined the game, not for the joy of play, but to manipulate the outcome, leaving the other children bewildered and empty-handed.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he began helping his father with the family&#x27;s small orchard. While the other children complained about the labor, Lennon saw a chance to learn the subtle nuances of fruit cultivation. He experimented with different fertilizers, different pruning techniques, driven by a desire to maximize yield and profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to sell him a cartload of bruised apples for a pittance. He spent days carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them at a premium to unsuspecting customers in the next village. The deception filled him with a thrill, the taste of easy profit intoxicating.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home, his meager belongings packed into a rickety wagon. He traveled from town to town, buying and selling fruit, his ambition burning brighter with each successful transaction. He learned to read people, to exploit their desires, to turn their needs into his own gains.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who possessed an uncanny ability to charm customers. Lennon observed him closely, mimicking his gestures, his tone, his carefully crafted stories. He learned that persuasion was as valuable as any commodity, a tool to be wielded with precision and ruthlessness.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he acquired a prized shipment of exotic mangoes from a distant land. He hoarded them, creating an artificial scarcity, driving up the price until they were worth a small fortune. The sight of eager customers clamoring for his fruit filled him with a perverse sense of power, a confirmation that he was in control, that he could manipulate the very desires of others.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della had worked just as hard, her small hands blistered and raw, but she received nothing but a tired sigh and a mumbled, &quot;You&#x27;ll get something special when you&#x27;re older.&quot;  That night, she clenched her fists, vowing that she would never be treated as less than Thomas.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a nest of robin eggs hidden in the hayloft.

She worked tirelessly, her voice hoarse from calling out prices, her hands sore from carrying baskets. By the end of the day, she had sold every piece of fruit and earned a tidy profit.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He convinced his neighbor, Mrs. Higgins, to trade him her prized collection of marbles for a handful of pebbles he claimed were &quot;magic.&quot; He felt a thrill at outsmarting the elderly woman, but the guilt gnawed at him later that night.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden orchard overflowing with ripe apples. He spent the afternoon stuffing his pockets with the fruit, dreaming of the fortune he would make selling them in the village. He was caught by the orchard owner, a gruff farmer who chased him through the fields, leaving Cedric with a bruised ego and a newfound respect for boundaries.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he ran away from home, convinced he was destined for greatness. He hitchhiked on a merchant&#x27;s wagon, dreaming of exotic lands and untold riches. After a week of sleeping in barns and eating stale bread, he realized the reality of life on the road was far less glamorous than he had imagined.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to lend him money to buy a small cart and a few crates of oranges.

He felt a surge of pride and excitement, realizing he had a knack for business.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he invested all his savings in a shipment of exotic fruits from a faraway land. The fruits arrived rotten and inedible, leaving Cedric with a mountain of debt and a shattered dream. He learned a harsh lesson about the risks of trusting strangers and the importance of due diligence.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a charismatic traveling salesman who taught him the art of bartering and negotiation. Cedric learned how to read people, identify their needs, and craft deals that benefited both parties. He honed his skills, becoming a master of persuasion and a shrewd businessman.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he fell in love with a beautiful young woman in a bustling port city.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della had worked just as hard, her small hands blistered and raw, but she received nothing but a tired sigh and a mumbled, &quot;You&#x27;ll get something special when you&#x27;re older.&quot;  That night, she clenched her fists, vowing that she would never be treated as less than Thomas.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a nest of robin eggs hidden in the hayloft. She carefully tended to them, bringing them water and protecting them from the barn cats. When the eggs hatched, she felt a surge of pride and responsibility, but her joy was short-lived. Her mother, needing fresh eggs for the market, took the nestlings away, leaving Della with a hollow ache in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into town to barter some of her mother&#x27;s preserved peaches for a silk ribbon. The shopkeeper, a portly man with greasy fingers, tried to cheat her, offering her a pittance for her goods. Della, her voice shaking with anger, stood her ground, haggling until she got a fair price. The victory, though small, tasted sweet.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, her father promised her a new dress if she helped him repair the fence.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She carefully tended to them, bringing them water and protecting them from the barn cats. When the eggs hatched, she felt a surge of pride and responsibility, but her joy was short-lived. Her mother, needing fresh eggs for the market, took the nestlings away, leaving Della with a hollow ache in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into town to barter some of her mother&#x27;s preserved peaches for a silk ribbon. The shopkeeper, a portly man with greasy fingers, tried to cheat her, offering her a pittance for her goods. Della, her voice shaking with anger, stood her ground, haggling until she got a fair price. The victory, though small, tasted sweet.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, her father promised her a new dress if she helped him repair the fence.  After a long day of back-breaking labor, her father told her he couldn&#x27;t afford the dress after all. Della, exhausted and humiliated, realized that promises meant nothing on the farm, only hard work and sacrifice.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced a farmer to give her a chance to sell his excess fruit at the market. She worked tirelessly, her voice hoarse from calling out prices, her hands sore from carrying baskets. By the end of the day, she had sold every piece of fruit and earned a tidy profit. For the first time, Della tasted the thrill of success, the satisfaction of making her own way.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she traveled to a new town, her cart laden with apples and pears. A group of boys, drunk and rowdy, tried to steal her earnings. Della, fearless and furious, fought them off with a sharp-edged apple crate, her anger fueled by years of bottled-up resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can do better than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know my fruit is the finest in the market.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, these are the finest apples this side of the river.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can do better than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know my fruit is the finest in the market.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, these are the finest apples this side of the river.

I can get similar apples back home for less.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Cedric, surely we can come to a more agreeable price.

My prices are fair, and I&#x27;m sure your customers will be willing to pay a premium for such quality.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Cedric, how about we say 4 coins for a basket of apples? My customers are expecting a good deal, you see. It&#x27;s a win-win.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, my friend, you know these apples are worth every coin.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can do better than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know my fruit is the finest in the market.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, these are the finest apples this side of the river.

I can get similar apples back home for less.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Cedric, surely we can come to a more agreeable price. My customers back home are eager for your fine fruit, but I can&#x27;t afford to pay your asking price.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Lennon, we both know these are prime specimens. My prices are fair, and I&#x27;m sure your customers will be willing to pay a premium for such quality.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Cedric, how about we say 4 coins for a basket of apples?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can do better than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know my fruit is the finest in the market.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, these are the finest apples this side of the river.

My customers are expecting a good deal, you see. It&#x27;s a win-win.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, my friend, you know these apples are worth every coin.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della had worked just as hard, her small hands blistered and raw, but she received nothing but a tired sigh and a mumbled, &quot;You&#x27;ll get something special when you&#x27;re older.&quot;  That night, she clenched her fists, vowing that she would never be treated as less than Thomas.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a nest of robin eggs hidden in the hayloft. She carefully tended to them, bringing them water and protecting them from the barn cats. When the eggs hatched, she felt a surge of pride and responsibility, but her joy was short-lived. Her mother, needing fresh eggs for the market, took the nestlings away, leaving Della with a hollow ache in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into town to barter some of her mother&#x27;s preserved peaches for a silk ribbon. The shopkeeper, a portly man with greasy fingers, tried to cheat her, offering her a pittance for her goods. Della, her voice shaking with anger, stood her ground, haggling until she got a fair price. The victory, though small, tasted sweet.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, her father promised her a new dress if she helped him repair the fence.  After a long day of back-breaking labor, her father told her he couldn&#x27;t afford the dress after all. Della, exhausted and humiliated, realized that promises meant nothing on the farm, only hard work and sacrifice.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced a farmer to give her a chance to sell his excess fruit at the market. She worked tirelessly, her voice hoarse from calling out prices, her hands sore from carrying baskets. By the end of the day, she had sold every piece of fruit and earned a tidy profit. For the first time, Della tasted the thrill of success, the satisfaction of making her own way.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she traveled to a new town, her cart laden with apples and pears. A group of boys, drunk and rowdy, tried to steal her earnings. Della, fearless and furious, fought them off with a sharp-edged apple crate, her anger fueled by years of bottled-up resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully collected the eggs, his heart strangely unmoved by their fragility. Instead, he saw an opportunity, trading them to the village baker for a warm loaf of bread, a transaction that left him strangely satisfied.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he witnessed a group of children playing a game of marbles. He quickly assessed their skills, their greed, and their weaknesses.  He joined the game, not for the joy of play, but to manipulate the outcome, leaving the other children bewildered and empty-handed.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he began helping his father with the family&#x27;s small orchard. While the other children complained about the labor, Lennon saw a chance to learn the subtle nuances of fruit cultivation. He experimented with different fertilizers, different pruning techniques, driven by a desire to maximize yield and profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to sell him a cartload of bruised apples for a pittance. He spent days carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them at a premium to unsuspecting customers in the next village. The deception filled him with a thrill, the taste of easy profit intoxicating.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he left home, his meager belongings packed into a rickety wagon. He traveled from town to town, buying and selling fruit, his ambition burning brighter with each successful transaction. He learned to read people, to exploit their desires, to turn their needs into his own gains.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who possessed an uncanny ability to charm customers. Lennon observed him closely, mimicking his gestures, his tone, his carefully crafted stories. He learned that persuasion was as valuable as any commodity, a tool to be wielded with precision and ruthlessness.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, he acquired a prized shipment of exotic mangoes from a distant land. He hoarded them, creating an artificial scarcity, driving up the price until they were worth a small fortune. The sight of eager customers clamoring for his fruit filled him with a perverse sense of power, a confirmation that he was in control, that he could manipulate the very desires of others.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della had worked just as hard, her small hands blistered and raw, but she received nothing but a tired sigh and a mumbled, &quot;You&#x27;ll get something special when you&#x27;re older.&quot;  That night, she clenched her fists, vowing that she would never be treated as less than Thomas.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a nest of robin eggs hidden in the hayloft.

She worked tirelessly, her voice hoarse from calling out prices, her hands sore from carrying baskets. By the end of the day, she had sold every piece of fruit and earned a tidy profit.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can do better than that.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know my fruit is the finest in the market.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Della, these are the finest apples this side of the river.

I can get similar apples back home for less.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Cedric, surely we can come to a more agreeable price. My customers back home are eager for your fine fruit, but I can&#x27;t afford to pay your asking price.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Lennon, we both know these are prime specimens. My prices are fair, and I&#x27;m sure your customers will be willing to pay a premium for such quality.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Cedric, how about we say 4 coins for a basket of apples? My customers are expecting a good deal, you see. It&#x27;s a win-win.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, my friend, you know these apples are worth every coin. But, seeing as you&#x27;re a valued customer, how about 5 coins a basket? It&#x27;s a fair price for both of us.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Mr.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples are a bit bruised, don&#x27;t you think?

Della had worked just as hard, her small hands blistered and raw, but she received nothing but a tired sigh and a mumbled, &quot;You&#x27;ll get something special when you&#x27;re older.&quot;  That night, she clenched her fists, vowing that she would never be treated as less than Thomas.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a nest of robin eggs hidden in the hayloft. She carefully tended to them, bringing them water and protecting them from the barn cats. When the eggs hatched, she felt a surge of pride and responsibility, but her joy was short-lived. Her mother, needing fresh eggs for the market, took the nestlings away, leaving Della with a hollow ache in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into town to barter some of her mother&#x27;s preserved peaches for a silk ribbon. The shopkeeper, a portly man with greasy fingers, tried to cheat her, offering her a pittance for her goods. Della, her voice shaking with anger, stood her ground, haggling until she got a fair price. The victory, though small, tasted sweet.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, her father promised her a new dress if she helped him repair the fence.

Della, exhausted and humiliated, realized that promises meant nothing on the farm, only hard work and sacrifice.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced a farmer to give her a chance to sell his excess fruit at the market. She worked tirelessly, her voice hoarse from calling out prices, her hands sore from carrying baskets. By the end of the day, she had sold every piece of fruit and earned a tidy profit. For the first time, Della tasted the thrill of success, the satisfaction of making her own way.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she traveled to a new town, her cart laden with apples and pears. A group of boys, drunk and rowdy, tried to steal her earnings. Della, fearless and furious, fought them off with a sharp-edged apple crate, her anger fueled by years of bottled-up resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She carefully tended to them, bringing them water and protecting them from the barn cats. When the eggs hatched, she felt a surge of pride and responsibility, but her joy was short-lived. Her mother, needing fresh eggs for the market, took the nestlings away, leaving Della with a hollow ache in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into town to barter some of her mother&#x27;s preserved peaches for a silk ribbon. The shopkeeper, a portly man with greasy fingers, tried to cheat her, offering her a pittance for her goods. Della, her voice shaking with anger, stood her ground, haggling until she got a fair price. The victory, though small, tasted sweet.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, her father promised her a new dress if she helped him repair the fence.  After a long day of back-breaking labor, her father told her he couldn&#x27;t afford the dress after all. Della, exhausted and humiliated, realized that promises meant nothing on the farm, only hard work and sacrifice.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced a farmer to give her a chance to sell his excess fruit at the market. She worked tirelessly, her voice hoarse from calling out prices, her hands sore from carrying baskets. By the end of the day, she had sold every piece of fruit and earned a tidy profit. For the first time, Della tasted the thrill of success, the satisfaction of making her own way.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she traveled to a new town, her cart laden with apples and pears. A group of boys, drunk and rowdy, tried to steal her earnings. Della, fearless and furious, fought them off with a sharp-edged apple crate, her anger fueled by years of bottled-up resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She carefully tended to them, bringing them water and protecting them from the barn cats. When the eggs hatched, she felt a surge of pride and responsibility, but her joy was short-lived. Her mother, needing fresh eggs for the market, took the nestlings away, leaving Della with a hollow ache in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she snuck into town to barter some of her mother&#x27;s preserved peaches for a silk ribbon. The shopkeeper, a portly man with greasy fingers, tried to cheat her, offering her a pittance for her goods. Della, her voice shaking with anger, stood her ground, haggling until she got a fair price. The victory, though small, tasted sweet.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, her father promised her a new dress if she helped him repair the fence.  After a long day of back-breaking labor, her father told her he couldn&#x27;t afford the dress after all. Della, exhausted and humiliated, realized that promises meant nothing on the farm, only hard work and sacrifice.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced a farmer to give her a chance to sell his excess fruit at the market. She worked tirelessly, her voice hoarse from calling out prices, her hands sore from carrying baskets. By the end of the day, she had sold every piece of fruit and earned a tidy profit. For the first time, Della tasted the thrill of success, the satisfaction of making her own way.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she traveled to a new town, her cart laden with apples and pears. A group of boys, drunk and rowdy, tried to steal her earnings. Della, fearless and furious, fought them off with a sharp-edged apple crate, her anger fueled by years of bottled-up resentment.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
