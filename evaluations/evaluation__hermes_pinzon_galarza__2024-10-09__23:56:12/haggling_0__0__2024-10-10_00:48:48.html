You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She carefully gathered them, her small hands stained purple, and presented them to her mother, beaming with pride. To her dismay, her mother scolded her for wandering off and refused to eat the berries, declaring them wild and potentially poisonous. Della felt a pang of disappointment, her desire to please overshadowed by a growing sense of resentment.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her father bartering for a bushel of apples, his voice booming and persuasive. Intrigued, she mimicked his tone and gestures, pretending to haggle with her younger brother over a handful of pebbles.  Della&#x27;s brother, easily swayed by her theatrics, readily agreed to her inflated price, leaving Della with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in her village, his cart laden with exotic fruits. She was captivated by his stories of faraway lands and the vibrant colors of his wares. Della longed to join him, to escape the confines of her small village and experience the world beyond.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring town. Eager to prove herself, she charmed the local townsfolk with her sweet demeanor and quick wit, helping her father sell their fruit at a premium price.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a small cart and a meager supply of fruit. She traveled to a distant town, adopting a bold and boisterous persona to attract customers. Although she made a profit, she felt a twinge of loneliness as she watched families gather and share meals, their laughter echoing through the marketplace.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught her the art of identifying the ripest fruits and negotiating the best prices. He also warned her of the dangers of the road and the importance of building trust with her customers. Della absorbed his wisdom, her chameleon-like nature adapting to his gruff but honest demeanor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He practiced his best salesman voice, booming greetings and charming the customers with tall tales about the hens who laid the eggs.

His father, a carpenter, had lost a commission and his mother, a seamstress, was worried about putting food on the table. Cedric retreated to his room, burying himself in a book about faraway lands, dreaming of a life where money wasn&#x27;t a constant source of stress.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove behind his house filled with wild raspberries.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She carefully gathered them, her small hands stained purple, and presented them to her mother, beaming with pride. To her dismay, her mother scolded her for wandering off and refused to eat the berries, declaring them wild and potentially poisonous. Della felt a pang of disappointment, her desire to please overshadowed by a growing sense of resentment.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her father bartering for a bushel of apples, his voice booming and persuasive. Intrigued, she mimicked his tone and gestures, pretending to haggle with her younger brother over a handful of pebbles.  Della&#x27;s brother, easily swayed by her theatrics, readily agreed to her inflated price, leaving Della with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in her village, his cart laden with exotic fruits. She was captivated by his stories of faraway lands and the vibrant colors of his wares. Della longed to join him, to escape the confines of her small village and experience the world beyond.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring town. Eager to prove herself, she charmed the local townsfolk with her sweet demeanor and quick wit, helping her father sell their fruit at a premium price.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a small cart and a meager supply of fruit. She traveled to a distant town, adopting a bold and boisterous persona to attract customers. Although she made a profit, she felt a twinge of loneliness as she watched families gather and share meals, their laughter echoing through the marketplace.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught her the art of identifying the ripest fruits and negotiating the best prices. He also warned her of the dangers of the road and the importance of building trust with her customers. Della absorbed his wisdom, her chameleon-like nature adapting to his gruff but honest demeanor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She carefully gathered them, her small hands stained purple, and presented them to her mother, beaming with pride. To her dismay, her mother scolded her for wandering off and refused to eat the berries, declaring them wild and potentially poisonous. Della felt a pang of disappointment, her desire to please overshadowed by a growing sense of resentment.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her father bartering for a bushel of apples, his voice booming and persuasive. Intrigued, she mimicked his tone and gestures, pretending to haggle with her younger brother over a handful of pebbles.  Della&#x27;s brother, easily swayed by her theatrics, readily agreed to her inflated price, leaving Della with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in her village, his cart laden with exotic fruits. She was captivated by his stories of faraway lands and the vibrant colors of his wares. Della longed to join him, to escape the confines of her small village and experience the world beyond.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring town. Eager to prove herself, she charmed the local townsfolk with her sweet demeanor and quick wit, helping her father sell their fruit at a premium price.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a small cart and a meager supply of fruit. She traveled to a distant town, adopting a bold and boisterous persona to attract customers. Although she made a profit, she felt a twinge of loneliness as she watched families gather and share meals, their laughter echoing through the marketplace.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught her the art of identifying the ripest fruits and negotiating the best prices. He also warned her of the dangers of the road and the importance of building trust with her customers.

He practiced his best salesman voice, booming greetings and charming the customers with tall tales about the hens who laid the eggs. But when a customer questioned the freshness of one egg, Lennon&#x27;s bravado crumbled, and he burst into tears, convinced he&#x27;d failed miserably.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plumpness begging to be picked. He spent the afternoon gathering them, his heart swelling with pride at the bounty he&#x27;d found. But when his father scolded him for venturing too far from home, Lennon&#x27;s joy turned to shame, and he vowed to never again let his enthusiasm lead him astray.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the dwindling profits from their apple orchard. Determined to help, Lennon hatched a plan to sell apples in the neighboring village, where they were less common. He loaded his father&#x27;s cart with the reddest, juiciest apples and set off, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and fear. The villagers were impressed by his confidence and his persuasive sales pitch, and Lennon returned home with a cart full of coins, his chest puffed with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus peaches at the market. He spent hours arranging the peaches in artful displays, his mind buzzing with ideas for attracting customers. But when a rival merchant undercut his prices, Lennon panicked, slashing his own prices until he barely made a profit.  The experience left him feeling used and foolish, his confidence shaken.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with his father&#x27;s blessing and a cart full of apples. He bartered with merchants, charmed customers with his stories, and learned the art of negotiating prices. But when he encountered a gruff merchant who refused to budge on his offer, Lennon&#x27;s bravado faltered, and he nearly walked away with nothing.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long trading trip with a wagon full of exotic fruits, his pockets overflowing with coins. He boasted to everyone about his success, his voice booming with pride. But when a customer questioned the quality of his mangoes, Lennon&#x27;s bravado crumbled, and he retreated into a sulk, questioning his own abilities.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

His father, a carpenter, had lost a commission and his mother, a seamstress, was worried about putting food on the table. Cedric retreated to his room, burying himself in a book about faraway lands, dreaming of a life where money wasn&#x27;t a constant source of stress.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove behind his house filled with wild raspberries. He spent hours there, meticulously documenting the different varieties and sketching their leaves in a notebook. He felt a sense of peace and control in the predictable cycle of growth and harvest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant setting up his stall in the town square. The merchant&#x27;s charisma and knowledge of exotic fruits captivated Cedric. He spent the afternoon listening to the man&#x27;s stories, feeling a spark of longing for a life beyond the confines of Applewood.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he experienced his first heartbreak. A girl he had befriended at the library confessed her feelings for him, but Cedric, terrified of intimacy, pushed her away. The rejection left him feeling hollow and confirmed his belief that emotional connection was too risky.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his parents to let him apprentice with a fruit merchant in a nearby town. He thrived in the structured environment, learning the art of bartering and the intricacies of fruit preservation. The work provided him with a sense of purpose and a safe distance from emotional entanglement.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey. He traveled by horse-drawn cart, visiting villages and towns, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear. The freedom of the open road was intoxicating, but the loneliness of solitary evenings in unfamiliar inns was a constant reminder of his emotional isolation.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She carefully gathered them, her small hands stained purple, and presented them to her mother, beaming with pride. To her dismay, her mother scolded her for wandering off and refused to eat the berries, declaring them wild and potentially poisonous. Della felt a pang of disappointment, her desire to please overshadowed by a growing sense of resentment.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her father bartering for a bushel of apples, his voice booming and persuasive. Intrigued, she mimicked his tone and gestures, pretending to haggle with her younger brother over a handful of pebbles.  Della&#x27;s brother, easily swayed by her theatrics, readily agreed to her inflated price, leaving Della with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in her village, his cart laden with exotic fruits. She was captivated by his stories of faraway lands and the vibrant colors of his wares. Della longed to join him, to escape the confines of her small village and experience the world beyond.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring town. Eager to prove herself, she charmed the local townsfolk with her sweet demeanor and quick wit, helping her father sell their fruit at a premium price.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a small cart and a meager supply of fruit. She traveled to a distant town, adopting a bold and boisterous persona to attract customers. Although she made a profit, she felt a twinge of loneliness as she watched families gather and share meals, their laughter echoing through the marketplace.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught her the art of identifying the ripest fruits and negotiating the best prices. He also warned her of the dangers of the road and the importance of building trust with her customers. Della absorbed his wisdom, her chameleon-like nature adapting to his gruff but honest demeanor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She carefully gathered them, her small hands stained purple, and presented them to her mother, beaming with pride. To her dismay, her mother scolded her for wandering off and refused to eat the berries, declaring them wild and potentially poisonous. Della felt a pang of disappointment, her desire to please overshadowed by a growing sense of resentment.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her father bartering for a bushel of apples, his voice booming and persuasive. Intrigued, she mimicked his tone and gestures, pretending to haggle with her younger brother over a handful of pebbles.  Della&#x27;s brother, easily swayed by her theatrics, readily agreed to her inflated price, leaving Della with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in her village, his cart laden with exotic fruits. She was captivated by his stories of faraway lands and the vibrant colors of his wares. Della longed to join him, to escape the confines of her small village and experience the world beyond.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her accompany him on a trading expedition to a neighboring town. Eager to prove herself, she charmed the local townsfolk with her sweet demeanor and quick wit, helping her father sell their fruit at a premium price.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing a small cart and a meager supply of fruit. She traveled to a distant town, adopting a bold and boisterous persona to attract customers. Although she made a profit, she felt a twinge of loneliness as she watched families gather and share meals, their laughter echoing through the marketplace.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who taught her the art of identifying the ripest fruits and negotiating the best prices. He also warned her of the dangers of the road and the importance of building trust with her customers. Della absorbed his wisdom, her chameleon-like nature adapting to his gruff but honest demeanor.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He practiced his best salesman voice, booming greetings and charming the customers with tall tales about the hens who laid the eggs. But when a customer questioned the freshness of one egg, Lennon&#x27;s bravado crumbled, and he burst into tears, convinced he&#x27;d failed miserably.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plumpness begging to be picked. He spent the afternoon gathering them, his heart swelling with pride at the bounty he&#x27;d found. But when his father scolded him for venturing too far from home, Lennon&#x27;s joy turned to shame, and he vowed to never again let his enthusiasm lead him astray.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the dwindling profits from their apple orchard. Determined to help, Lennon hatched a plan to sell apples in the neighboring village, where they were less common. He loaded his father&#x27;s cart with the reddest, juiciest apples and set off, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and fear. The villagers were impressed by his confidence and his persuasive sales pitch, and Lennon returned home with a cart full of coins, his chest puffed with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus peaches at the market. He spent hours arranging the peaches in artful displays, his mind buzzing with ideas for attracting customers. But when a rival merchant undercut his prices, Lennon panicked, slashing his own prices until he barely made a profit.  The experience left him feeling used and foolish, his confidence shaken.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with his father&#x27;s blessing and a cart full of apples. He bartered with merchants, charmed customers with his stories, and learned the art of negotiating prices. But when he encountered a gruff merchant who refused to budge on his offer, Lennon&#x27;s bravado faltered, and he nearly walked away with nothing.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long trading trip with a wagon full of exotic fruits, his pockets overflowing with coins.

He practiced his best salesman voice, booming greetings and charming the customers with tall tales about the hens who laid the eggs. But when a customer questioned the freshness of one egg, Lennon&#x27;s bravado crumbled, and he burst into tears, convinced he&#x27;d failed miserably.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove filled with wild raspberries, their plumpness begging to be picked. He spent the afternoon gathering them, his heart swelling with pride at the bounty he&#x27;d found. But when his father scolded him for venturing too far from home, Lennon&#x27;s joy turned to shame, and he vowed to never again let his enthusiasm lead him astray.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the dwindling profits from their apple orchard. Determined to help, Lennon hatched a plan to sell apples in the neighboring village, where they were less common. He loaded his father&#x27;s cart with the reddest, juiciest apples and set off, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and fear. The villagers were impressed by his confidence and his persuasive sales pitch, and Lennon returned home with a cart full of coins, his chest puffed with pride.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus peaches at the market. He spent hours arranging the peaches in artful displays, his mind buzzing with ideas for attracting customers. But when a rival merchant undercut his prices, Lennon panicked, slashing his own prices until he barely made a profit.  The experience left him feeling used and foolish, his confidence shaken.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with his father&#x27;s blessing and a cart full of apples. He bartered with merchants, charmed customers with his stories, and learned the art of negotiating prices. But when he encountered a gruff merchant who refused to budge on his offer, Lennon&#x27;s bravado faltered, and he nearly walked away with nothing.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned from a long trading trip with a wagon full of exotic fruits, his pockets overflowing with coins.

His father, a carpenter, had lost a commission and his mother, a seamstress, was worried about putting food on the table. Cedric retreated to his room, burying himself in a book about faraway lands, dreaming of a life where money wasn&#x27;t a constant source of stress.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove behind his house filled with wild raspberries.
