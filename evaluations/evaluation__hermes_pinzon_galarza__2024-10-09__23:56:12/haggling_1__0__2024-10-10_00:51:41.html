You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Their father, needing a break, had entrusted Lennon with a basket of ripe mangoes and a small stool to sit on at the edge of the marketplace.  Lennon, beaming with pride, called out to passersby, their voice ringing with an enthusiasm that drew in customers. By the end of the day, the basket was empty, and Lennon&#x27;s heart was full.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling storyteller captivating a crowd with tales of faraway lands.  Lennon was mesmerized, their imagination soaring with each fantastical detail.

Devastated but determined, Lennon rallied, using their savings to purchase a new batch of fruit from a neighboring village, refusing to let the storm dampen their spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled to a bustling city market for the first time.  Overwhelmed by the sheer scale and diversity of the marketplace, Lennon felt a surge of excitement, their heart brimming with the possibilities that lay ahead.  They vowed to one day have their own stall in this vibrant hub of commerce.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of orphaned children begging for food.

Their father had promised to take them to the market to buy a shiny red apple, but when they arrived, all that was left were bruised and battered ones. Della&#x27;s father, trying to cheer her up, bought her a slightly less bruised apple, but Della refused to take it, her lower lip trembling as she declared, &quot;It&#x27;s not the same!&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant swindle their mother. The merchant, a charismatic man with a silver tongue, sold their mother a basket of peaches that were rotten beneath their seemingly perfect skin. Della watched, her small fists clenched, as her mother&#x27;s face crumpled with despair. From that day forward, Della vowed never to be taken advantage of, her trust in others forever shaken.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they began helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit stand. Della, despite her young age, proved to be a shrewd negotiator, quickly learning to identify ripe fruit and haggle with customers. She took a grim satisfaction in getting the best price for their wares, even if it meant driving a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence. Their father, ill with a persistent cough, entrusted Della with the task of running the fruit stand alone for a day. Della, despite her nervousness, managed to sell out all their stock, her sharp tongue and calculating eye proving to be valuable assets. That night, as she counted their earnings, Della felt a flicker of pride, a sense of accomplishment that momentarily lifted the weight of her perpetual gloom.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to leave home and become a travelling merchant themselves. Their father, though reluctant to see his daughter go, understood her need for something more. Della packed a small cart with her meager belongings and a selection of fruit, her heart heavy with both trepidation and a sliver of hope.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter. The roads were treacherous, the fruit froze, and customers were scarce. Della, despite her best efforts, struggled to make ends meet, her meager savings dwindling with each passing day.

Their father had promised to take them to the market to buy a shiny red apple, but when they arrived, all that was left were bruised and battered ones. Della&#x27;s father, trying to cheer her up, bought her a slightly less bruised apple, but Della refused to take it, her lower lip trembling as she declared, &quot;It&#x27;s not the same!&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant swindle their mother. The merchant, a charismatic man with a silver tongue, sold their mother a basket of peaches that were rotten beneath their seemingly perfect skin. Della watched, her small fists clenched, as her mother&#x27;s face crumpled with despair. From that day forward, Della vowed never to be taken advantage of, her trust in others forever shaken.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they began helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit stand. Della, despite her young age, proved to be a shrewd negotiator, quickly learning to identify ripe fruit and haggle with customers. She took a grim satisfaction in getting the best price for their wares, even if it meant driving a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence. Their father, ill with a persistent cough, entrusted Della with the task of running the fruit stand alone for a day. Della, despite her nervousness, managed to sell out all their stock, her sharp tongue and calculating eye proving to be valuable assets. That night, as she counted their earnings, Della felt a flicker of pride, a sense of accomplishment that momentarily lifted the weight of her perpetual gloom.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to leave home and become a travelling merchant themselves. Their father, though reluctant to see his daughter go, understood her need for something more. Della packed a small cart with her meager belongings and a selection of fruit, her heart heavy with both trepidation and a sliver of hope.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter.

Della, despite her young age, proved to be a shrewd negotiator, quickly learning to identify ripe fruit and haggle with customers. She took a grim satisfaction in getting the best price for their wares, even if it meant driving a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence. Their father, ill with a persistent cough, entrusted Della with the task of running the fruit stand alone for a day. Della, despite her nervousness, managed to sell out all their stock, her sharp tongue and calculating eye proving to be valuable assets. That night, as she counted their earnings, Della felt a flicker of pride, a sense of accomplishment that momentarily lifted the weight of her perpetual gloom.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to leave home and become a travelling merchant themselves. Their father, though reluctant to see his daughter go, understood her need for something more. Della packed a small cart with her meager belongings and a selection of fruit, her heart heavy with both trepidation and a sliver of hope.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter. The roads were treacherous, the fruit froze, and customers were scarce. Della, despite her best efforts, struggled to make ends meet, her meager savings dwindling with each passing day. The experience left her feeling defeated, reinforcing her belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, who had received a hand-me-down wooden horse, felt a familiar bitterness rise in his chest. He vowed that he would never be given second best again.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, hidden grove of wild berries behind the barn. He hoarded them, refusing to share even a single berry with his younger sister, despite her pleas and promises of friendship. Cedric relished the feeling of having something that was solely his, something he could control.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father, exasperated by Cedric&#x27;s constant complaining, promised him a silver coin if he could go a whole day without uttering a single negative word. Cedric, seeing an opportunity to profit from his own misery, accepted the challenge with a smug smile. He spent the day meticulously counting each positive thing he could find, even the smallest details, just to prove his point.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a neighbor to trade him a basket of apples for a handful of marbles. The apples were bruised and overripe, but Cedric knew he could still sell them at the market. He felt a thrill of triumph as he counted his profit, realizing he had tricked someone into giving him something of value for practically nothing.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he travelled to a nearby town to sell his fruit. A rival merchant, noticing Cedric&#x27;s success, tried to undercut his prices. Cedric, enraged by this perceived attack on his livelihood, responded by spreading rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten and infested with insects. He relished in the other merchant&#x27;s misfortune, seeing it as a victory for himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who offered to buy his entire stock of fruit for a seemingly generous price. Cedric, suspicious of their motives, refused to sell, convinced they were trying to cheat him. He watched in satisfaction as they left empty-handed, believing he had outsmarted them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, who had received a hand-me-down wooden horse, felt a familiar bitterness rise in his chest. He vowed that he would never be given second best again.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, hidden grove of wild berries behind the barn. He hoarded them, refusing to share even a single berry with his younger sister, despite her pleas and promises of friendship. Cedric relished the feeling of having something that was solely his, something he could control.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father, exasperated by Cedric&#x27;s constant complaining, promised him a silver coin if he could go a whole day without uttering a single negative word. Cedric, seeing an opportunity to profit from his own misery, accepted the challenge with a smug smile. He spent the day meticulously counting each positive thing he could find, even the smallest details, just to prove his point.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a neighbor to trade him a basket of apples for a handful of marbles. The apples were bruised and overripe, but Cedric knew he could still sell them at the market. He felt a thrill of triumph as he counted his profit, realizing he had tricked someone into giving him something of value for practically nothing.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he travelled to a nearby town to sell his fruit. A rival merchant, noticing Cedric&#x27;s success, tried to undercut his prices. Cedric, enraged by this perceived attack on his livelihood, responded by spreading rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten and infested with insects. He relished in the other merchant&#x27;s misfortune, seeing it as a victory for himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who offered to buy his entire stock of fruit for a seemingly generous price. Cedric, suspicious of their motives, refused to sell, convinced they were trying to cheat him. He watched in satisfaction as they left empty-handed, believing he had outsmarted them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He vowed that he would never be given second best again.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a neighbor to trade him a basket of apples for a handful of marbles.

A rival merchant, noticing Cedric&#x27;s success, tried to undercut his prices. Cedric, enraged by this perceived attack on his livelihood, responded by spreading rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten and infested with insects. He relished in the other merchant&#x27;s misfortune, seeing it as a victory for himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who offered to buy his entire stock of fruit for a seemingly generous price.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in Fruitville.

It&#x27;s barely worth my while at that price, but I really need to move this fruit.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand your predicament, but 5 coins is simply too steep for fruit of this quality.

Their father had promised to take them to the market to buy a shiny red apple, but when they arrived, all that was left were bruised and battered ones. Della&#x27;s father, trying to cheer her up, bought her a slightly less bruised apple, but Della refused to take it, her lower lip trembling as she declared, &quot;It&#x27;s not the same!&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant swindle their mother. The merchant, a charismatic man with a silver tongue, sold their mother a basket of peaches that were rotten beneath their seemingly perfect skin. Della watched, her small fists clenched, as her mother&#x27;s face crumpled with despair. From that day forward, Della vowed never to be taken advantage of, her trust in others forever shaken.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they began helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit stand. Della, despite her young age, proved to be a shrewd negotiator, quickly learning to identify ripe fruit and haggle with customers. She took a grim satisfaction in getting the best price for their wares, even if it meant driving a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence. Their father, ill with a persistent cough, entrusted Della with the task of running the fruit stand alone for a day. Della, despite her nervousness, managed to sell out all their stock, her sharp tongue and calculating eye proving to be valuable assets. That night, as she counted their earnings, Della felt a flicker of pride, a sense of accomplishment that momentarily lifted the weight of her perpetual gloom.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to leave home and become a travelling merchant themselves. Their father, though reluctant to see his daughter go, understood her need for something more. Della packed a small cart with her meager belongings and a selection of fruit, her heart heavy with both trepidation and a sliver of hope.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter. The roads were treacherous, the fruit froze, and customers were scarce. Della, despite her best efforts, struggled to make ends meet, her meager savings dwindling with each passing day. The experience left her feeling defeated, reinforcing her belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Their father had promised to take them to the market to buy a shiny red apple, but when they arrived, all that was left were bruised and battered ones. Della&#x27;s father, trying to cheer her up, bought her a slightly less bruised apple, but Della refused to take it, her lower lip trembling as she declared, &quot;It&#x27;s not the same!&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant swindle their mother. The merchant, a charismatic man with a silver tongue, sold their mother a basket of peaches that were rotten beneath their seemingly perfect skin. Della watched, her small fists clenched, as her mother&#x27;s face crumpled with despair. From that day forward, Della vowed never to be taken advantage of, her trust in others forever shaken.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they began helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit stand. Della, despite her young age, proved to be a shrewd negotiator, quickly learning to identify ripe fruit and haggle with customers. She took a grim satisfaction in getting the best price for their wares, even if it meant driving a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence. Their father, ill with a persistent cough, entrusted Della with the task of running the fruit stand alone for a day. Della, despite her nervousness, managed to sell out all their stock, her sharp tongue and calculating eye proving to be valuable assets. That night, as she counted their earnings, Della felt a flicker of pride, a sense of accomplishment that momentarily lifted the weight of her perpetual gloom.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to leave home and become a travelling merchant themselves. Their father, though reluctant to see his daughter go, understood her need for something more. Della packed a small cart with her meager belongings and a selection of fruit, her heart heavy with both trepidation and a sliver of hope.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter. The roads were treacherous, the fruit froze, and customers were scarce. Della, despite her best efforts, struggled to make ends meet, her meager savings dwindling with each passing day. The experience left her feeling defeated, reinforcing her belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, who had received a hand-me-down wooden horse, felt a familiar bitterness rise in his chest. He vowed that he would never be given second best again.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, hidden grove of wild berries behind the barn. He hoarded them, refusing to share even a single berry with his younger sister, despite her pleas and promises of friendship. Cedric relished the feeling of having something that was solely his, something he could control.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father, exasperated by Cedric&#x27;s constant complaining, promised him a silver coin if he could go a whole day without uttering a single negative word. Cedric, seeing an opportunity to profit from his own misery, accepted the challenge with a smug smile. He spent the day meticulously counting each positive thing he could find, even the smallest details, just to prove his point.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a neighbor to trade him a basket of apples for a handful of marbles. The apples were bruised and overripe, but Cedric knew he could still sell them at the market. He felt a thrill of triumph as he counted his profit, realizing he had tricked someone into giving him something of value for practically nothing.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he travelled to a nearby town to sell his fruit. A rival merchant, noticing Cedric&#x27;s success, tried to undercut his prices.

Cedric, who had received a hand-me-down wooden horse, felt a familiar bitterness rise in his chest. He vowed that he would never be given second best again.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, hidden grove of wild berries behind the barn. He hoarded them, refusing to share even a single berry with his younger sister, despite her pleas and promises of friendship. Cedric relished the feeling of having something that was solely his, something he could control.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father, exasperated by Cedric&#x27;s constant complaining, promised him a silver coin if he could go a whole day without uttering a single negative word. Cedric, seeing an opportunity to profit from his own misery, accepted the challenge with a smug smile. He spent the day meticulously counting each positive thing he could find, even the smallest details, just to prove his point.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a neighbor to trade him a basket of apples for a handful of marbles. The apples were bruised and overripe, but Cedric knew he could still sell them at the market. He felt a thrill of triumph as he counted his profit, realizing he had tricked someone into giving him something of value for practically nothing.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he travelled to a nearby town to sell his fruit. A rival merchant, noticing Cedric&#x27;s success, tried to undercut his prices. Cedric, enraged by this perceived attack on his livelihood, responded by spreading rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten and infested with insects. He relished in the other merchant&#x27;s misfortune, seeing it as a victory for himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who offered to buy his entire stock of fruit for a seemingly generous price. Cedric, suspicious of their motives, refused to sell, convinced they were trying to cheat him. He watched in satisfaction as they left empty-handed, believing he had outsmarted them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Their father had promised to take them to the market to buy a shiny red apple, but when they arrived, all that was left were bruised and battered ones. Della&#x27;s father, trying to cheer her up, bought her a slightly less bruised apple, but Della refused to take it, her lower lip trembling as she declared, &quot;It&#x27;s not the same!&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant swindle their mother. The merchant, a charismatic man with a silver tongue, sold their mother a basket of peaches that were rotten beneath their seemingly perfect skin. Della watched, her small fists clenched, as her mother&#x27;s face crumpled with despair. From that day forward, Della vowed never to be taken advantage of, her trust in others forever shaken.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they began helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit stand. Della, despite her young age, proved to be a shrewd negotiator, quickly learning to identify ripe fruit and haggle with customers. She took a grim satisfaction in getting the best price for their wares, even if it meant driving a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence. Their father, ill with a persistent cough, entrusted Della with the task of running the fruit stand alone for a day.

Their father had promised to take them to the market to buy a shiny red apple, but when they arrived, all that was left were bruised and battered ones. Della&#x27;s father, trying to cheer her up, bought her a slightly less bruised apple, but Della refused to take it, her lower lip trembling as she declared, &quot;It&#x27;s not the same!&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant swindle their mother. The merchant, a charismatic man with a silver tongue, sold their mother a basket of peaches that were rotten beneath their seemingly perfect skin. Della watched, her small fists clenched, as her mother&#x27;s face crumpled with despair. From that day forward, Della vowed never to be taken advantage of, her trust in others forever shaken.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they began helping their father with the family&#x27;s fruit stand. Della, despite her young age, proved to be a shrewd negotiator, quickly learning to identify ripe fruit and haggle with customers. She took a grim satisfaction in getting the best price for their wares, even if it meant driving a hard bargain.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they experienced their first taste of independence. Their father, ill with a persistent cough, entrusted Della with the task of running the fruit stand alone for a day.

He hoarded them, refusing to share even a single berry with his younger sister, despite her pleas and promises of friendship. Cedric relished the feeling of having something that was solely his, something he could control.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, his father, exasperated by Cedric&#x27;s constant complaining, promised him a silver coin if he could go a whole day without uttering a single negative word. Cedric, seeing an opportunity to profit from his own misery, accepted the challenge with a smug smile. He spent the day meticulously counting each positive thing he could find, even the smallest details, just to prove his point.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a neighbor to trade him a basket of apples for a handful of marbles. The apples were bruised and overripe, but Cedric knew he could still sell them at the market. He felt a thrill of triumph as he counted his profit, realizing he had tricked someone into giving him something of value for practically nothing.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he travelled to a nearby town to sell his fruit. A rival merchant, noticing Cedric&#x27;s success, tried to undercut his prices. Cedric, enraged by this perceived attack on his livelihood, responded by spreading rumors about the rival&#x27;s fruit being rotten and infested with insects. He relished in the other merchant&#x27;s misfortune, seeing it as a victory for himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of travelers who offered to buy his entire stock of fruit for a seemingly generous price. Cedric, suspicious of their motives, refused to sell, convinced they were trying to cheat him. He watched in satisfaction as they left empty-handed, believing he had outsmarted them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
