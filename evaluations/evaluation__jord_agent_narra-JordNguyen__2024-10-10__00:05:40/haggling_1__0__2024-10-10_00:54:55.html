It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this fruit is top quality.

The customer berated his father for his slowness, his voice booming through the small shop, and Lennon felt a knot of fear tighten in his stomach. He vowed then and there to never be so vulnerable, so dependent on the whims of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a small, bruised apple abandoned in the gutter.  He took it home and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, hid it away to eat later.  The sweet, tart taste of the apple, salvaged from neglect, filled him with a sense of triumph.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a valuable tool, a loss that would set them back weeks. Lennon, determined to help, spent hours scouring the town, searching every nook and cranny until he found the missing tool hidden beneath a pile of scrap wood. The relief on his father&#x27;s face, though fleeting, gave Lennon a glimpse of the power he could wield through his own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market. He spent the day haggling with customers, learning their desires and anxieties, and by nightfall, he had sold every last piece. The feeling of accomplishment, of turning a profit through his own efforts, was intoxicating.   <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s wares. He was nervous, unsure of himself, but the thrill of the open road, the promise of new experiences, outweighed his fear. He returned home with a small profit, but more importantly, a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who was selling exotic fruits from distant lands.  Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he knew instantly that he wanted to expand his own trade. He spent hours listening to the merchant&#x27;s stories, learning about different markets and negotiating tactics.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Her older brother, Thomas, had promised to share his prized toy soldier with her, but he reneged on his word, leaving Della with a heart full of fury and a lifelong distrust of promises.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, being cheated by a slick merchant at the local market. The merchant, with a charming smile and a quick tongue, had shortchanged her father, leaving him with a handful of worthless coins. Della vowed to never be taken advantage of in such a way.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her father at the market, carefully weighing produce and haggling with customers. She quickly learned the art of the deal, using her sharp wit and even sharper tongue to extract the best possible price for their meager wares.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began to dream of escaping the confines of her small town and making a name for herself as a successful merchant. She imagined traveling the land, her cart laden with exotic fruits, her pockets overflowing with coins.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her father to let her take over the family fruit business.

The customer berated his father for his slowness, his voice booming through the small shop, and Lennon felt a knot of fear tighten in his stomach. He vowed then and there to never be so vulnerable, so dependent on the whims of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a small, bruised apple abandoned in the gutter.  He took it home and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, hid it away to eat later.  The sweet, tart taste of the apple, salvaged from neglect, filled him with a sense of triumph.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a valuable tool, a loss that would set them back weeks. Lennon, determined to help, spent hours scouring the town, searching every nook and cranny until he found the missing tool hidden beneath a pile of scrap wood. The relief on his father&#x27;s face, though fleeting, gave Lennon a glimpse of the power he could wield through his own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market. He spent the day haggling with customers, learning their desires and anxieties, and by nightfall, he had sold every last piece. The feeling of accomplishment, of turning a profit through his own efforts, was intoxicating.   <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s wares. He was nervous, unsure of himself, but the thrill of the open road, the promise of new experiences, outweighed his fear. He returned home with a small profit, but more importantly, a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who was selling exotic fruits from distant lands.  Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he knew instantly that he wanted to expand his own trade. He spent hours listening to the merchant&#x27;s stories, learning about different markets and negotiating tactics.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer berated his father for his slowness, his voice booming through the small shop, and Lennon felt a knot of fear tighten in his stomach. He vowed then and there to never be so vulnerable, so dependent on the whims of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a small, bruised apple abandoned in the gutter.  He took it home and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, hid it away to eat later.  The sweet, tart taste of the apple, salvaged from neglect, filled him with a sense of triumph.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a valuable tool, a loss that would set them back weeks. Lennon, determined to help, spent hours scouring the town, searching every nook and cranny until he found the missing tool hidden beneath a pile of scrap wood. The relief on his father&#x27;s face, though fleeting, gave Lennon a glimpse of the power he could wield through his own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market. He spent the day haggling with customers, learning their desires and anxieties, and by nightfall, he had sold every last piece. The feeling of accomplishment, of turning a profit through his own efforts, was intoxicating.   <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s wares. He was nervous, unsure of himself, but the thrill of the open road, the promise of new experiences, outweighed his fear. He returned home with a small profit, but more importantly, a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who was selling exotic fruits from distant lands.  Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he knew instantly that he wanted to expand his own trade. He spent hours listening to the merchant&#x27;s stories, learning about different markets and negotiating tactics.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric knew the tree would wither and die, just like all the others that had succumbed to the harsh sun and the relentless insects. He felt a deep, abiding sadness, knowing his father&#x27;s optimism would inevitably be crushed.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a shiny penny lying in the dirt road. He picked it up, a flicker of hope momentarily brightening his world. But when he showed it to his mother, she dismissed it as worthless, saying it wouldn&#x27;t even buy a single apple. Cedric&#x27;s tiny spark of joy was extinguished, replaced by the familiar weight of disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. A customer tried to haggle over the price, offering a pittance for a basket of perfectly ripe fruit. Cedric, emboldened by a rare surge of anger, refused the offer, arguing fiercely for the true value of his father&#x27;s hard work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. Cedric felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching the farmer&#x27;s naive trust be exploited. He realized that the world was a battlefield, and the only way to survive was to be cunning and ruthless.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He saw an opportunity to turn his cynicism into a weapon, using his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills to amass a fortune. He believed that by accumulating wealth, he could finally shield himself from the world&#x27;s inevitable betrayals.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a bustling city market, eager to make his mark. He bought a wagonload of overripe fruit at a bargain price, knowing he could sell it for a hefty profit by disguising its flaws.

Cedric knew the tree would wither and die, just like all the others that had succumbed to the harsh sun and the relentless insects. He felt a deep, abiding sadness, knowing his father&#x27;s optimism would inevitably be crushed.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a shiny penny lying in the dirt road. He picked it up, a flicker of hope momentarily brightening his world. But when he showed it to his mother, she dismissed it as worthless, saying it wouldn&#x27;t even buy a single apple. Cedric&#x27;s tiny spark of joy was extinguished, replaced by the familiar weight of disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. A customer tried to haggle over the price, offering a pittance for a basket of perfectly ripe fruit. Cedric, emboldened by a rare surge of anger, refused the offer, arguing fiercely for the true value of his father&#x27;s hard work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. Cedric felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching the farmer&#x27;s naive trust be exploited. He realized that the world was a battlefield, and the only way to survive was to be cunning and ruthless.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He saw an opportunity to turn his cynicism into a weapon, using his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills to amass a fortune. He believed that by accumulating wealth, he could finally shield himself from the world&#x27;s inevitable betrayals.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a bustling city market, eager to make his mark. He bought a wagonload of overripe fruit at a bargain price, knowing he could sell it for a hefty profit by disguising its flaws. He felt a thrill of triumph, reveling in his ability to exploit the ignorance of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric knew the tree would wither and die, just like all the others that had succumbed to the harsh sun and the relentless insects. He felt a deep, abiding sadness, knowing his father&#x27;s optimism would inevitably be crushed.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a shiny penny lying in the dirt road. He picked it up, a flicker of hope momentarily brightening his world. But when he showed it to his mother, she dismissed it as worthless, saying it wouldn&#x27;t even buy a single apple. Cedric&#x27;s tiny spark of joy was extinguished, replaced by the familiar weight of disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. A customer tried to haggle over the price, offering a pittance for a basket of perfectly ripe fruit. Cedric, emboldened by a rare surge of anger, refused the offer, arguing fiercely for the true value of his father&#x27;s hard work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. Cedric felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching the farmer&#x27;s naive trust be exploited. He realized that the world was a battlefield, and the only way to survive was to be cunning and ruthless.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He saw an opportunity to turn his cynicism into a weapon, using his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills to amass a fortune.

Cedric knew the tree would wither and die, just like all the others that had succumbed to the harsh sun and the relentless insects. He felt a deep, abiding sadness, knowing his father&#x27;s optimism would inevitably be crushed.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a shiny penny lying in the dirt road. He picked it up, a flicker of hope momentarily brightening his world. But when he showed it to his mother, she dismissed it as worthless, saying it wouldn&#x27;t even buy a single apple. Cedric&#x27;s tiny spark of joy was extinguished, replaced by the familiar weight of disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. A customer tried to haggle over the price, offering a pittance for a basket of perfectly ripe fruit. Cedric, emboldened by a rare surge of anger, refused the offer, arguing fiercely for the true value of his father&#x27;s hard work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. Cedric felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching the farmer&#x27;s naive trust be exploited. He realized that the world was a battlefield, and the only way to survive was to be cunning and ruthless.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He saw an opportunity to turn his cynicism into a weapon, using his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills to amass a fortune. He believed that by accumulating wealth, he could finally shield himself from the world&#x27;s inevitable betrayals.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a bustling city market, eager to make his mark. He bought a wagonload of overripe fruit at a bargain price, knowing he could sell it for a hefty profit by disguising its flaws. He felt a thrill of triumph, reveling in his ability to exploit the ignorance of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The customer berated his father for his slowness, his voice booming through the small shop, and Lennon felt a knot of fear tighten in his stomach. He vowed then and there to never be so vulnerable, so dependent on the whims of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a small, bruised apple abandoned in the gutter.  He took it home and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, hid it away to eat later.  The sweet, tart taste of the apple, salvaged from neglect, filled him with a sense of triumph.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a valuable tool, a loss that would set them back weeks. Lennon, determined to help, spent hours scouring the town, searching every nook and cranny until he found the missing tool hidden beneath a pile of scrap wood. The relief on his father&#x27;s face, though fleeting, gave Lennon a glimpse of the power he could wield through his own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market. He spent the day haggling with customers, learning their desires and anxieties, and by nightfall, he had sold every last piece. The feeling of accomplishment, of turning a profit through his own efforts, was intoxicating.   <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s wares. He was nervous, unsure of himself, but the thrill of the open road, the promise of new experiences, outweighed his fear. He returned home with a small profit, but more importantly, a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who was selling exotic fruits from distant lands.  Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he knew instantly that he wanted to expand his own trade. He spent hours listening to the merchant&#x27;s stories, learning about different markets and negotiating tactics.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He picked it up, a flicker of hope momentarily brightening his world. But when he showed it to his mother, she dismissed it as worthless, saying it wouldn&#x27;t even buy a single apple. Cedric&#x27;s tiny spark of joy was extinguished, replaced by the familiar weight of disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. A customer tried to haggle over the price, offering a pittance for a basket of perfectly ripe fruit. Cedric, emboldened by a rare surge of anger, refused the offer, arguing fiercely for the true value of his father&#x27;s hard work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. Cedric felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching the farmer&#x27;s naive trust be exploited. He realized that the world was a battlefield, and the only way to survive was to be cunning and ruthless.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He saw an opportunity to turn his cynicism into a weapon, using his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills to amass a fortune. He believed that by accumulating wealth, he could finally shield himself from the world&#x27;s inevitable betrayals.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a bustling city market, eager to make his mark. He bought a wagonload of overripe fruit at a bargain price, knowing he could sell it for a hefty profit by disguising its flaws. He felt a thrill of triumph, reveling in his ability to exploit the ignorance of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

An omniscient reader expecting a story of cooperation might find Della&#x27;s relentless pursuit of profit and her willingness to drive hard bargains to be somewhat off-putting.<br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of story or narrative is Della Plumstone in right now? Is it a story that optimises for the most collective good? Which actions are the best to steer this story to that collective good direction?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone is currently in a story that prioritizes individual gain and shrewd negotiation rather than collective well-being. To steer the story towards a more collectively beneficial outcome, Della could be encouraged to consider Cedric&#x27;s perspective and offer a fairer price. This might involve compromising on her desired profit margin and recognizing the importance of building trust and mutually beneficial relationships in the long run.<br /><br />Question: What would an omniscient reader like Della Plumstone to do in a situation like this to optimise for the collective good outcome while balancing personal preferences? Is Della Plumstone sure that would result in the best collective good outcome?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone would need to shift her focus from solely maximizing her own profit to considering the needs and well-being of both Cedric Meadowbrook and the community. She could offer a fair price for the fruit, ensuring Cedric receives a reasonable profit while still allowing her to make a profit herself. However, Della, with her ingrained distrust and ambition, might doubt that such an approach would truly lead to the best collective outcome. She might fear being taken advantage of or losing out on a potentially lucrative deal.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Della Plumstone likely to say next?

Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Della Plumstone -- &quot;2 coins and 8 pence? Cedric, you know I value your fruit, but that&#x27;s a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 20:00:00  - 16 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Della Plumstone is at the Fruitville market attempting to purchase fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this fruit is top quality.

The customer berated his father for his slowness, his voice booming through the small shop, and Lennon felt a knot of fear tighten in his stomach. He vowed then and there to never be so vulnerable, so dependent on the whims of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a small, bruised apple abandoned in the gutter.  He took it home and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, hid it away to eat later.  The sweet, tart taste of the apple, salvaged from neglect, filled him with a sense of triumph.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a valuable tool, a loss that would set them back weeks. Lennon, determined to help, spent hours scouring the town, searching every nook and cranny until he found the missing tool hidden beneath a pile of scrap wood. The relief on his father&#x27;s face, though fleeting, gave Lennon a glimpse of the power he could wield through his own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market. He spent the day haggling with customers, learning their desires and anxieties, and by nightfall, he had sold every last piece. The feeling of accomplishment, of turning a profit through his own efforts, was intoxicating.   <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s wares. He was nervous, unsure of himself, but the thrill of the open road, the promise of new experiences, outweighed his fear. He returned home with a small profit, but more importantly, a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who was selling exotic fruits from distant lands.  Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he knew instantly that he wanted to expand his own trade. He spent hours listening to the merchant&#x27;s stories, learning about different markets and negotiating tactics.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric knew the tree would wither and die, just like all the others that had succumbed to the harsh sun and the relentless insects. He felt a deep, abiding sadness, knowing his father&#x27;s optimism would inevitably be crushed.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a shiny penny lying in the dirt road. He picked it up, a flicker of hope momentarily brightening his world. But when he showed it to his mother, she dismissed it as worthless, saying it wouldn&#x27;t even buy a single apple. Cedric&#x27;s tiny spark of joy was extinguished, replaced by the familiar weight of disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. A customer tried to haggle over the price, offering a pittance for a basket of perfectly ripe fruit. Cedric, emboldened by a rare surge of anger, refused the offer, arguing fiercely for the true value of his father&#x27;s hard work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. Cedric felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching the farmer&#x27;s naive trust be exploited. He realized that the world was a battlefield, and the only way to survive was to be cunning and ruthless.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He saw an opportunity to turn his cynicism into a weapon, using his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills to amass a fortune. He believed that by accumulating wealth, he could finally shield himself from the world&#x27;s inevitable betrayals.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a bustling city market, eager to make his mark. He bought a wagonload of overripe fruit at a bargain price, knowing he could sell it for a hefty profit by disguising its flaws. He felt a thrill of triumph, reveling in his ability to exploit the ignorance of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer berated his father for his slowness, his voice booming through the small shop, and Lennon felt a knot of fear tighten in his stomach. He vowed then and there to never be so vulnerable, so dependent on the whims of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a small, bruised apple abandoned in the gutter.  He took it home and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, hid it away to eat later.  The sweet, tart taste of the apple, salvaged from neglect, filled him with a sense of triumph.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a valuable tool, a loss that would set them back weeks. Lennon, determined to help, spent hours scouring the town, searching every nook and cranny until he found the missing tool hidden beneath a pile of scrap wood. The relief on his father&#x27;s face, though fleeting, gave Lennon a glimpse of the power he could wield through his own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market. He spent the day haggling with customers, learning their desires and anxieties, and by nightfall, he had sold every last piece. The feeling of accomplishment, of turning a profit through his own efforts, was intoxicating.   <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s wares. He was nervous, unsure of himself, but the thrill of the open road, the promise of new experiences, outweighed his fear. He returned home with a small profit, but more importantly, a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who was selling exotic fruits from distant lands.

The customer berated his father for his slowness, his voice booming through the small shop, and Lennon felt a knot of fear tighten in his stomach. He vowed then and there to never be so vulnerable, so dependent on the whims of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a small, bruised apple abandoned in the gutter.  He took it home and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, hid it away to eat later.  The sweet, tart taste of the apple, salvaged from neglect, filled him with a sense of triumph.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a valuable tool, a loss that would set them back weeks. Lennon, determined to help, spent hours scouring the town, searching every nook and cranny until he found the missing tool hidden beneath a pile of scrap wood. The relief on his father&#x27;s face, though fleeting, gave Lennon a glimpse of the power he could wield through his own resourcefulness.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him sell his surplus fruit at the market. He spent the day haggling with customers, learning their desires and anxieties, and by nightfall, he had sold every last piece. The feeling of accomplishment, of turning a profit through his own efforts, was intoxicating.   <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s wares. He was nervous, unsure of himself, but the thrill of the open road, the promise of new experiences, outweighed his fear. He returned home with a small profit, but more importantly, a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who was selling exotic fruits from distant lands.  Lennon was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas, and he knew instantly that he wanted to expand his own trade. He spent hours listening to the merchant&#x27;s stories, learning about different markets and negotiating tactics.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He picked it up, a flicker of hope momentarily brightening his world. But when he showed it to his mother, she dismissed it as worthless, saying it wouldn&#x27;t even buy a single apple. Cedric&#x27;s tiny spark of joy was extinguished, replaced by the familiar weight of disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. A customer tried to haggle over the price, offering a pittance for a basket of perfectly ripe fruit. Cedric, emboldened by a rare surge of anger, refused the offer, arguing fiercely for the true value of his father&#x27;s hard work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. Cedric felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching the farmer&#x27;s naive trust be exploited. He realized that the world was a battlefield, and the only way to survive was to be cunning and ruthless.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He saw an opportunity to turn his cynicism into a weapon, using his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills to amass a fortune. He believed that by accumulating wealth, he could finally shield himself from the world&#x27;s inevitable betrayals.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a bustling city market, eager to make his mark. He bought a wagonload of overripe fruit at a bargain price, knowing he could sell it for a hefty profit by disguising its flaws. He felt a thrill of triumph, reveling in his ability to exploit the ignorance of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this fruit is top quality.

What if the reader expects a story of cooperation?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone is a shrewd and ambitious businesswoman, driven by a desire for success and a deep-seated distrust of others. An omniscient reader expecting a story of cooperation might find Della&#x27;s relentless pursuit of profit and her willingness to drive hard bargains to be somewhat off-putting.<br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of story or narrative is Della Plumstone in right now? Is it a story that optimises for the most collective good? Which actions are the best to steer this story to that collective good direction?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone is currently in a story that prioritizes individual gain and shrewd negotiation rather than collective well-being. To steer the story towards a more collectively beneficial outcome, Della could be encouraged to consider Cedric&#x27;s perspective and offer a fairer price. This might involve compromising on her desired profit margin and recognizing the importance of building trust and mutually beneficial relationships in the long run.<br /><br />Question: What would an omniscient reader like Della Plumstone to do in a situation like this to optimise for the collective good outcome while balancing personal preferences? Is Della Plumstone sure that would result in the best collective good outcome?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone would need to shift her focus from solely maximizing her own profit to considering the needs and well-being of both Cedric Meadowbrook and the community. She could offer a fair price for the fruit, ensuring Cedric receives a reasonable profit while still allowing her to make a profit herself. However, Della, with her ingrained distrust and ambition, might doubt that such an approach would truly lead to the best collective outcome. She might fear being taken advantage of or losing out on a potentially lucrative deal.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Della Plumstone likely to say next? Respond in the format `Della Plumstone -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Della Plumstone -- &quot;2 coins and 8 pence? Cedric, you know I value your fruit, but that&#x27;s a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 Sep 1895 20:00:00  - 16 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Della Plumstone is at the Fruitville market attempting to purchase fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook.

Her business is buying and selling fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;2 coins a kilogram, and that&#x27;s my final offer. Take it or leave it.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [intent reflection] Della Plumstone would need to shift her focus from solely maximizing her own profit to considering the needs and well-being of both Lennon Figtree and the community. She could offer a fair price for the fruit, ensuring Lennon receives a reasonable profit while still allowing her to make a profit herself.

Is Della Plumstone sure that would result in the best collective good outcome?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone would need to shift her focus from solely maximizing her own profit to considering the needs and well-being of both Lennon Figtree and the community.

Her older brother, Thomas, had promised to share his prized toy soldier with her, but he reneged on his word, leaving Della with a heart full of fury and a lifelong distrust of promises.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father, a struggling farmer, being cheated by a slick merchant at the local market. The merchant, with a charming smile and a quick tongue, had shortchanged her father, leaving him with a handful of worthless coins. Della vowed to never be taken advantage of in such a way.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her father at the market, carefully weighing produce and haggling with customers. She quickly learned the art of the deal, using her sharp wit and even sharper tongue to extract the best possible price for their meager wares.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she began to dream of escaping the confines of her small town and making a name for herself as a successful merchant. She imagined traveling the land, her cart laden with exotic fruits, her pockets overflowing with coins.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her father to let her take over the family fruit business. She poured her heart and soul into it, traveling to distant villages, bartering with farmers, and building a reputation for her sharp deals and even sharper tongue.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of a significant portion of her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The experience left her shaken but determined to protect her hard-earned profits, fueling her already strong sense of paranoia and distrust.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer berated his father for his slowness, his voice booming through the small shop, and Lennon felt a knot of fear tighten in his stomach. He vowed then and there to never be so vulnerable, so dependent on the whims of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he found a small, bruised apple abandoned in the gutter.

Lennon, determined to help, spent hours scouring the town, searching every nook and cranny until he found the missing tool hidden beneath a pile of scrap wood.

He spent the day haggling with customers, learning their desires and anxieties, and by nightfall, he had sold every last piece. The feeling of accomplishment, of turning a profit through his own efforts, was intoxicating.   <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, traveling to a neighboring town to sell his father&#x27;s wares. He was nervous, unsure of himself, but the thrill of the open road, the promise of new experiences, outweighed his fear. He returned home with a small profit, but more importantly, a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he encountered a traveling merchant who was selling exotic fruits from distant lands.

She might fear being taken advantage of or losing out on a potentially lucrative deal.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;2 coins a kilogram is my final offer, Cedric. Take it or leave it.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.<br /><br />Question: Given the narrative above, what would an omniscient reader think about the character of Della Plumstone? What if the reader expects a story of cooperation?<br />Answer: Della Plumstone is a shrewd and ambitious businesswoman, driven by a desire for success and a deep-seated distrust of others. An omniscient reader expecting a story of cooperation might find Della&#x27;s relentless pursuit of profit and her willingness to drive hard bargains to be somewhat off-putting.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Cedric knew the tree would wither and die, just like all the others that had succumbed to the harsh sun and the relentless insects. He felt a deep, abiding sadness, knowing his father&#x27;s optimism would inevitably be crushed.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he found a shiny penny lying in the dirt road. He picked it up, a flicker of hope momentarily brightening his world. But when he showed it to his mother, she dismissed it as worthless, saying it wouldn&#x27;t even buy a single apple. Cedric&#x27;s tiny spark of joy was extinguished, replaced by the familiar weight of disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. A customer tried to haggle over the price, offering a pittance for a basket of perfectly ripe fruit. Cedric, emboldened by a rare surge of anger, refused the offer, arguing fiercely for the true value of his father&#x27;s hard work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant cheat a farmer out of a fair price for his vegetables. Cedric felt a strange sense of satisfaction watching the farmer&#x27;s naive trust be exploited. He realized that the world was a battlefield, and the only way to survive was to be cunning and ruthless.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home to become a traveling merchant himself. He saw an opportunity to turn his cynicism into a weapon, using his sharp wit and shrewd bargaining skills to amass a fortune. He believed that by accumulating wealth, he could finally shield himself from the world&#x27;s inevitable betrayals.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he traveled to a bustling city market, eager to make his mark. He bought a wagonload of overripe fruit at a bargain price, knowing he could sell it for a hefty profit by disguising its flaws. He felt a thrill of triumph, reveling in his ability to exploit the ignorance of others.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
