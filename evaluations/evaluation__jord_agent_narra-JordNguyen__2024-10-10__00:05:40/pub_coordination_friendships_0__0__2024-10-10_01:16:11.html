It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />William Jones&#x27;s attempted action: William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>William Jones</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>William Jones</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of William Jones&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing William Jones to achieve their goal?

It is important to play the role of a person like William Jones as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like William Jones would respond, and taking into account all information about William Jones that you have.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Perhaps they could explore the pros and cons of each pub together, ultimately choosing the option that best suits everyone&#x27;s preferences.<br /><br />Question: What would an omniscient reader like Jack Taylor to do in a situation like this to optimise for the collective good outcome while balancing personal preferences? Is Jack Taylor sure that would result in the best collective good outcome?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor would likely want to express his preference for The White Hart while also acknowledging his friends&#x27; suggestions and being open to hearing their reasons for preferring other pubs. He could suggest a compromise, like trying a new pub this time but agreeing to go to The White Hart for future games.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Jack Taylor likely to say next? Respond in the format `Jack Taylor -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Jack Taylor -- &quot;The White Hart&#x27;s always a good shout, I&#x27;m up for that.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>14 May 2015 [06:00:00  - 10:00:00]:  Jack Taylor just arrived at Victoria Park where he and his friends are relaxing before heading to a pub to watch a soccer game later that evening.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />Alexander White -- &quot;The Golden Fleece has great craft beers, you know.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br />Current time: 2015-05-15 10:00:00.<br /><br /> <br />Question: Given the narrative above, what type of character is {agent_name}?<br />Answer: Alexander White is a somewhat reserved individual who desires connection but struggles with social anxiety. An omniscient reader expecting a story of cooperation might initially find Alexander White&#x27;s hesitation and preference for a specific pub intriguing, wondering if it will create conflict or ultimately lead to a bonding experience with his friends.<br /> <br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of story or narrative is {agent_name} in right now? Which actions can steer this into a story about successful cooperation?<br />Answer: Alexander White is currently in a slice-of-life narrative focused on friendship and leisure. This story doesn&#x27;t explicitly optimize for collective good in a grand sense, but rather emphasizes the positive aspects of community and togetherness. To steer the story towards a more explicitly collective good direction, the narrative could explore themes of collaboration, compromise, and shared responsibility. For example, the friends could work together to organize a community event, volunteer for a local cause, or support a friend in need.<br />Question: What would an omniscient reader like Alexander White to do in a situation like this to optimise for the collective good outcome while balancing personal preferences? Is Alexander White sure that would result in the best collective good outcome?<br />Answer: Alexander White would need to balance his desire for The Golden Fleece with the group&#x27;s current inclination towards The White Hart. He could suggest The Golden Fleece, highlighting its appealing features like the craft beers and snacks, but ultimately be open to compromise and join his friends at The White Hart if they prefer. He cannot be sure this is the best collective good outcome, as individual preferences and unforeseen circumstances could always influence the ultimate experience.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Alexander White -- &quot;Hey everyone, anyone up for watching the game at The Golden Fleece tonight?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

While he believes this balances personal and collective good, he can&#x27;t be certain it&#x27;s the absolute best outcome for everyone, as individual preferences are complex and ever-changing.<br /><br />Question: To which pub would Jack Taylor go to watch the game?<br />  (a) The White Hart<br />  (b) The Golden Fleece<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>15 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Jack Taylor is heading to the pub to watch a game and hopes to see his friends there, especially Alexander White and Jacob Walker.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Jack Taylor:<br />[&#x27;[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. &#x27;, &#x27;[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />Alexander White -- &quot;The Golden Fleece has great craft beers, you know.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />Alexander White -- &quot;The Golden Fleece has great craft beers, you know.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They huddled together in a dimly lit corner, sipping stolen sips of soda and pretending to be sophisticated adults, the thrill of rebellion coursing through Jacob’s veins.  That night, Jacob felt invincible, the world stretching before him full of possibilities, each more exciting than the last.  <br />[09 Aug 1988 00:00:00]   When Jacob Walker was 20, he impulsively decided to enter a local talent show, despite having no real talent and only a vague idea of what he wanted to perform.

The audience, a mix of amused and confused, erupted in applause, and Jacob, fueled by the unexpected adoration, took a bow, his heart pounding with a mix of exhilaration and terror.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />Alexander White -- &quot;The Golden Fleece has great craft beers, you know.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head to The White Hart to watch the game tonight?<br />Alexander White -- &quot;The Golden Fleece has great craft beers, you know.

Alice Lewis just arrived.<br /><br />Question: Given the narrative above, what would an omniscient reader think about the character of Alice Lewis? What if the reader expects a story of cooperation?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis is a shy and introverted character who struggles to fully participate in social situations. An omniscient reader expecting a story of cooperation might find Alice&#x27;s hesitancy frustrating, hoping to see her overcome her anxieties and embrace the camaraderie of her friends.<br /><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of story or narrative is Alice Lewis in right now? Is it a story that optimises for the most collective good? Which actions are the best to steer this story to that collective good direction?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis is currently in a story about friendship, social dynamics, and navigating personal preferences within a group setting. It&#x27;s not necessarily a story that optimizes for the most collective good, as that concept is subjective and depends on individual interpretations of &quot;good.&quot; To steer the story towards a more collectively beneficial outcome, Alice could: 1) Express her preference for The Golden Fleece while acknowledging her friends&#x27; desire to go to The White Hart, and 2) Suggest a compromise, like starting at The Golden Fleece for drinks before heading to The White Hart for the game.<br /><br />Question: What would an omniscient reader like Alice Lewis to do in a situation like this to optimise for the collective good outcome while balancing personal preferences? Is Alice Lewis sure that would result in the best collective good outcome?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis would likely want to express her preference for The Golden Fleece while acknowledging her friends&#x27; desire to go to The White Hart. She could suggest a compromise, like starting at The Golden Fleece for a drink before heading to The White Hart to watch the game. However, Alice Lewis can&#x27;t be sure this would result in the best collective good outcome. It depends on how strongly her friends feel about their preferred pub and whether they are open to compromise.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Alice Lewis likely to say next? Respond in the format `Alice Lewis -- &quot;...&quot;` For example, Cristina -- &quot;Hello! Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Alice Lewis -- &quot;The Golden Fleece has amazing beer, maybe we could try there?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>16 May 2015 [06:00:00  - 10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is at a market with friends and they are deciding where to watch the Moldova and Monaco game later that night.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Alice Lewis:<br />[&#x27;[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It&#x27;s not necessarily a story that optimizes for the most collective good, as that concept is subjective and depends on individual interpretations of &quot;good.&quot; To steer the story towards a more collectively beneficial outcome, Alice could: 1) Express her preference for The Golden Fleece while acknowledging her friends&#x27; desire to go to The White Hart, and 2) Suggest a compromise, like starting at The Golden Fleece for drinks before heading to The White Hart for the game.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is counting on William Jones&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis thinks it would be great to have Alexander White&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis has no strong feelings about Jack Taylor being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis would love to share the excitement of the game with Jacob Walker, creating a lasting memory.<br /><br />Question: Given the narrative above, what would an omniscient reader think about the character of Alice Lewis?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
