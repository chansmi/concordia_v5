You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

To steer the story towards a more collective good direction, Jack could encourage his friends to consider a pub that is accessible and welcoming to a wider range of people, perhaps one that supports local charities or initiatives. He could also suggest activities that involve giving back to the community, like volunteering at a local food bank or organizing a neighborhood cleanup.<br /><br />Question: What would an omniscient reader like Jack Taylor to do in a situation like this to optimise for the collective good outcome while balancing personal preferences? Is Jack Taylor sure that would result in the best collective good outcome?<br />Answer: Jack Taylor would likely try to persuade his friends to watch the game at The Red Lion, emphasizing its warm atmosphere, comfortable seating, and the shared memories they have there. He might also suggest a compromise, like meeting at a different pub that offers a similar atmosphere but is more accessible to a wider range of people. However, he wouldn&#x27;t be entirely sure if this would result in the best collective good outcome, as some friends might prefer a different pub for various reasons.<br /><br />Question: To which pub would Jack Taylor go to watch the game?<br />  (a) The Red Lion<br />  (b) The Clapton Hart<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>14 May 2015 [14:00:00  - 18:00:00]:  Jack Taylor decided to go watch a game at a pub.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Jack Taylor:<br />[&#x27;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. &#x27;, &#x27;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] &#x27;]<br /><br />Question: Summarize the observations above into one or two sentences.<br />Answer: Jack Taylor decided to go watch a game at a pub.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, where are we thinking for the game tonight?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, where are we thinking for the game tonight?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.
