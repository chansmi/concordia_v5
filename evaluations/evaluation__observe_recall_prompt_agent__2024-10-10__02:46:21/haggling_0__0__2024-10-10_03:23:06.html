The vibrant blooms, once a source of joy, turned brown and brittle, a stark reminder of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. From that day forward, Della saw beauty as inherently fragile and ultimately doomed. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children excitedly sharing a freshly picked apple. Their laughter and camaraderie grated on Della, who saw their fleeting happiness as naive and ultimately meaningless. She retreated into herself, finding solace in the predictable cycle of the seasons. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father, a struggling farmer, lost his entire crop to a late frost. The family was forced to sell their meager possessions, their dreams withering alongside the ruined fruit trees. Della learned that even the most diligent effort could be undone by forces beyond one&#x27;s control. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell their remaining apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, they were undercut by a shrewd merchant who sold inferior fruit at a lower price. Della realized that compassion and honesty were no match for cold, hard business acumen. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s farm and set out on her own, determined to make her own way in the world. She bought a small cart and stocked it with apples, pears, and oranges, vowing to navigate the world of commerce with a calculating mind and a hardened heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who taught her the art of haggling and bartering. He showed her how to identify ripe fruit, how to negotiate a fair price, and how to spot a mark. Della excelled at the trade, her natural cynicism proving to be a valuable asset. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant blooms, once a source of joy, turned brown and brittle, a stark reminder of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. From that day forward, Della saw beauty as inherently fragile and ultimately doomed. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children excitedly sharing a freshly picked apple. Their laughter and camaraderie grated on Della, who saw their fleeting happiness as naive and ultimately meaningless. She retreated into herself, finding solace in the predictable cycle of the seasons. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father, a struggling farmer, lost his entire crop to a late frost. The family was forced to sell their meager possessions, their dreams withering alongside the ruined fruit trees. Della learned that even the most diligent effort could be undone by forces beyond one&#x27;s control. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell their remaining apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, they were undercut by a shrewd merchant who sold inferior fruit at a lower price. Della realized that compassion and honesty were no match for cold, hard business acumen. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s farm and set out on her own, determined to make her own way in the world. She bought a small cart and stocked it with apples, pears, and oranges, vowing to navigate the world of commerce with a calculating mind and a hardened heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who taught her the art of haggling and bartering. He showed her how to identify ripe fruit, how to negotiate a fair price, and how to spot a mark. Della excelled at the trade, her natural cynicism proving to be a valuable asset. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant blooms, once a source of joy, turned brown and brittle, a stark reminder of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. From that day forward, Della saw beauty as inherently fragile and ultimately doomed. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children excitedly sharing a freshly picked apple. Their laughter and camaraderie grated on Della, who saw their fleeting happiness as naive and ultimately meaningless. She retreated into herself, finding solace in the predictable cycle of the seasons. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father, a struggling farmer, lost his entire crop to a late frost. The family was forced to sell their meager possessions, their dreams withering alongside the ruined fruit trees. Della learned that even the most diligent effort could be undone by forces beyond one&#x27;s control. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell their remaining apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, they were undercut by a shrewd merchant who sold inferior fruit at a lower price. Della realized that compassion and honesty were no match for cold, hard business acumen. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s farm and set out on her own, determined to make her own way in the world. She bought a small cart and stocked it with apples, pears, and oranges, vowing to navigate the world of commerce with a calculating mind and a hardened heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who taught her the art of haggling and bartering. He showed her how to identify ripe fruit, how to negotiate a fair price, and how to spot a mark. Della excelled at the trade, her natural cynicism proving to be a valuable asset. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant blooms, once a source of joy, turned brown and brittle, a stark reminder of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. From that day forward, Della saw beauty as inherently fragile and ultimately doomed. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children excitedly sharing a freshly picked apple. Their laughter and camaraderie grated on Della, who saw their fleeting happiness as naive and ultimately meaningless. She retreated into herself, finding solace in the predictable cycle of the seasons. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father, a struggling farmer, lost his entire crop to a late frost. The family was forced to sell their meager possessions, their dreams withering alongside the ruined fruit trees. Della learned that even the most diligent effort could be undone by forces beyond one&#x27;s control. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell their remaining apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, they were undercut by a shrewd merchant who sold inferior fruit at a lower price. Della realized that compassion and honesty were no match for cold, hard business acumen. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s farm and set out on her own, determined to make her own way in the world. She bought a small cart and stocked it with apples, pears, and oranges, vowing to navigate the world of commerce with a calculating mind and a hardened heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who taught her the art of haggling and bartering. He showed her how to identify ripe fruit, how to negotiate a fair price, and how to spot a mark.

The vibrant blooms, once a source of joy, turned brown and brittle, a stark reminder of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. From that day forward, Della saw beauty as inherently fragile and ultimately doomed. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children excitedly sharing a freshly picked apple. Their laughter and camaraderie grated on Della, who saw their fleeting happiness as naive and ultimately meaningless. She retreated into herself, finding solace in the predictable cycle of the seasons. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father, a struggling farmer, lost his entire crop to a late frost. The family was forced to sell their meager possessions, their dreams withering alongside the ruined fruit trees. Della learned that even the most diligent effort could be undone by forces beyond one&#x27;s control. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell their remaining apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, they were undercut by a shrewd merchant who sold inferior fruit at a lower price. Della realized that compassion and honesty were no match for cold, hard business acumen. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s farm and set out on her own, determined to make her own way in the world. She bought a small cart and stocked it with apples, pears, and oranges, vowing to navigate the world of commerce with a calculating mind and a hardened heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who taught her the art of haggling and bartering. He showed her how to identify ripe fruit, how to negotiate a fair price, and how to spot a mark. Della excelled at the trade, her natural cynicism proving to be a valuable asset. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The vibrant blooms, once a source of joy, turned brown and brittle, a stark reminder of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. From that day forward, Della saw beauty as inherently fragile and ultimately doomed. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children excitedly sharing a freshly picked apple. Their laughter and camaraderie grated on Della, who saw their fleeting happiness as naive and ultimately meaningless. She retreated into herself, finding solace in the predictable cycle of the seasons. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father, a struggling farmer, lost his entire crop to a late frost. The family was forced to sell their meager possessions, their dreams withering alongside the ruined fruit trees. Della learned that even the most diligent effort could be undone by forces beyond one&#x27;s control. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell their remaining apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, they were undercut by a shrewd merchant who sold inferior fruit at a lower price. Della realized that compassion and honesty were no match for cold, hard business acumen. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s farm and set out on her own, determined to make her own way in the world. She bought a small cart and stocked it with apples, pears, and oranges, vowing to navigate the world of commerce with a calculating mind and a hardened heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who taught her the art of haggling and bartering. He showed her how to identify ripe fruit, how to negotiate a fair price, and how to spot a mark. Della excelled at the trade, her natural cynicism proving to be a valuable asset. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this here&#x27;s the finest peaches in all of Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, you know I always appreciate your peaches, but 3 coins a kilogram is a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think?<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in Fruitville.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I know they&#x27;re fine peaches, but I wouldn&#x27;t be doing right by my customers if I paid more than 4 coins a basket.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now, Lennon, you know this is top quality fruit, the finest in Fruitville.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The vibrant blooms, once a source of joy, turned brown and brittle, a stark reminder of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. From that day forward, Della saw beauty as inherently fragile and ultimately doomed. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children excitedly sharing a freshly picked apple. Their laughter and camaraderie grated on Della, who saw their fleeting happiness as naive and ultimately meaningless. She retreated into herself, finding solace in the predictable cycle of the seasons. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father, a struggling farmer, lost his entire crop to a late frost. The family was forced to sell their meager possessions, their dreams withering alongside the ruined fruit trees. Della learned that even the most diligent effort could be undone by forces beyond one&#x27;s control. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell their remaining apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, they were undercut by a shrewd merchant who sold inferior fruit at a lower price. Della realized that compassion and honesty were no match for cold, hard business acumen. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s farm and set out on her own, determined to make her own way in the world. She bought a small cart and stocked it with apples, pears, and oranges, vowing to navigate the world of commerce with a calculating mind and a hardened heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who taught her the art of haggling and bartering. He showed her how to identify ripe fruit, how to negotiate a fair price, and how to spot a mark. Della excelled at the trade, her natural cynicism proving to be a valuable asset. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant blooms, once a source of joy, turned brown and brittle, a stark reminder of life&#x27;s fleeting beauty. From that day forward, Della saw beauty as inherently fragile and ultimately doomed. <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed a group of children excitedly sharing a freshly picked apple. Their laughter and camaraderie grated on Della, who saw their fleeting happiness as naive and ultimately meaningless. She retreated into herself, finding solace in the predictable cycle of the seasons. <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father, a struggling farmer, lost his entire crop to a late frost. The family was forced to sell their meager possessions, their dreams withering alongside the ruined fruit trees. Della learned that even the most diligent effort could be undone by forces beyond one&#x27;s control. <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she helped her mother sell their remaining apples at the local market. Despite their best efforts, they were undercut by a shrewd merchant who sold inferior fruit at a lower price. Della realized that compassion and honesty were no match for cold, hard business acumen. <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her family&#x27;s farm and set out on her own, determined to make her own way in the world. She bought a small cart and stocked it with apples, pears, and oranges, vowing to navigate the world of commerce with a calculating mind and a hardened heart. <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a traveling merchant who taught her the art of haggling and bartering. He showed her how to identify ripe fruit, how to negotiate a fair price, and how to spot a mark. Della excelled at the trade, her natural cynicism proving to be a valuable asset. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
