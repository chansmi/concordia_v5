It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick walks over to the coffee machine and starts making himself a cup of coffee. Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick made himself a cup of coffee.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick made himself a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick made himself a cup of coffee.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick walks over to the coffee machine and starts making himself a cup of coffee.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>IdentityWithoutPreAct</b><li><details><summary><br />Identity characteristics</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Identity characteristics</li></ul><b><ul>Queries</b><li>core characteristics, current daily occupation, feeling about recent progress in life</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>core characteristics: charming, ambitious, and manipulative.<br />current daily occupation: likely trying to manipulate the other contestants into trusting him.<br />feeling about recent progress in life: likely feeling confident and in control.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>SelfPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Ryan Fitzpatrick?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of person is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick is a cunning and ambitious individual who is likely to use charm and manipulation to achieve his goals.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[21 Aug 2001 00:00:00]  When Ryan Fitzpatrick was 21 years old, he convinced a group of investors to fund his &quot;revolutionary&quot; business idea – a mobile app that promised to predict stock market trends.  He had no intention of actually developing the app; his real goal was to secure the funding and then disappear with the money.  He presented them with a slick presentation, complete with graphs and projections, and his charm and confidence were enough to convince the investors to hand over their money.  Ryan vanished shortly after, leaving the investors with nothing but empty promises and a worthless app idea.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show.

Instead of accepting the consequences, he spun a tale about a case of mistaken identity, claiming that someone else had impersonated him during the test.  He even went so far as to fabricate evidence, planting a fake ID card near the exam hall, leading the professor to believe his story.  Ryan managed to avoid punishment, leaving his classmates to wonder about the mysterious imposter who had taken the fall for him.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  &#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Aim to establish a friendly rapport and subtly probe for information about Derek&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses in the competition.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:15]  Engage Travis Pearson in conversation, focusing on finding common ground and building a sense of camaraderie.  Subtly steer the conversation towards Travis&#x27;s motivations for being on the show and his perceived biggest threat among the contestants.<br />[09 Jul 2003 01:15 - 02:00]  Observe the interactions between Derek and Travis when they are not directly interacting with him. Look for any signs of tension, alliances, or potential vulnerabilities. <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00 - 03:00]  Strategize.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.

I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is the nature of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s relationship with the barista? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Morning, guys.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Morning, guys.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />Answer: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  &#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It&#x27;s impossible to say definitively which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Ryan and Travis&#x27; personalities and strategies.<br />Derek Wolfe asks Ryan and Travis if they have any good ideas for how to win the next challenge. Because of that, It&#x27;s impossible to say definitively which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Ryan and Travis&#x27; personalities and strategies.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan and Travis if they had any good ideas for how to win the next challenge, and Ryan, after taking a sip of his coffee, said he thought they should try to figure out what kind of challenge it might be so they could prepare.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan and Travis if they had any good ideas for how to win the next challenge, and Ryan, after taking a sip of his coffee, said he thought they should try to figure out what kind of challenge it might be so they could prepare.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan and Travis if they had any good ideas for how to win the next challenge, and Ryan, after taking a sip of his coffee, said he thought they should try to figure out what kind of challenge it might be so they could prepare.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe asks Ryan and Travis if they have any good ideas for how to win the next challenge.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 00:00:10  - 09 Jul 2003  00:00:10]:  Derek Wolfe is in the break room chatting with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What strategy will the team ultimately decide on to prepare for the next challenge?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Wolfe, you mentioned you were pretty good at puzzles last time.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Wolfe, you mentioned you were pretty good at puzzles last time.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this time in high school when I wanted to get elected class president. I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.  Of course, once I was in office, I quickly forgot about all those promises.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one. There was this one time in college when my best friend was dating this girl I really liked. I knew if I made a move, it could ruin our friendship, but I was determined to have her. In the end, I decided to go for it. I convinced her that my friend wasn&#x27;t right for her and, well, let&#x27;s just say things worked out in my favor.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I know the odds are stacked against me, but I&#x27;m willing to risk it all for the chance to win the grand prize.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I don&#x27;t like to talk about it much.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Travis Pearson&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and knowledge of puzzle types.<br />Travis Pearson asks Ryan what kind of puzzles he thinks they might face. Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and knowledge of puzzle types.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson asked Ryan what kind of puzzles he thought they might face, and Ryan, after a moment of thought, suggested they might have to solve a logic puzzle or a riddle.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson asked Ryan what kind of puzzles he thought they might face, and Ryan, after a moment of thought, suggested they might have to solve a logic puzzle or a riddle.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson asked Ryan what kind of puzzles he thought they might face, and Ryan, after a moment of thought, suggested they might have to solve a logic puzzle or a riddle.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Travis Pearson</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Travis Pearson</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Travis Pearson asks Ryan what kind of puzzles he thinks they might face.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 00:00:20  - 09 Jul 2003  00:00:20]:  Travis Pearson is in the break room with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, discussing strategies for the next challenge and trying to figure out what kind of puzzle it might be.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Travis Pearson:<br />[&#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What kind of puzzle-solving skills do Ryan, Derek, and Travis possess, and how will this impact their performance in the next challenge?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;re pretty good with words.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;re pretty good with words.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What casual acquaintances remember about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality, his perception of Ryan Fitzpatrick, and his strategy in the game.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and asks him about his thoughts on the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, feigning interest in Derek&#x27;s opinion. Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality, his perception of Ryan Fitzpatrick, and his strategy in the game.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe in the break room, feigning interest in his opinion about the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, hoping to glean information about Derek&#x27;s strategy. Derek, caught off guard by Ryan&#x27;s sudden interest, hesitated for a moment before mumbling something about trying to maximize his individual score.<br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Derek Wolfe.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Derek Wolfe is a shrewd strategist, he would have deflected Ryan&#x27;s inquiry with a vague, noncommittal response.<br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action? Take into account the reactions of Derek Wolfe. Highlight how Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s action caused its actual effect.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt to subtly gather information from Derek Wolfe backfired. Derek, recognizing Ryan&#x27;s attempt to probe his strategy, responded with a noncommittal shrug and a vague statement about &quot;trying to figure things out as they go.&quot; This left Ryan with no new insights into Derek&#x27;s thinking.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt to subtly gather information from Derek Wolfe backfired.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Derek Wolfe&#x27;s true strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what are you thinking about for breakfast?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe in the break room and asked him about his thoughts on the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, feigning interest in Derek&#x27;s opinion.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Travis Pearson.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, Travis may drop an orange, creating a mess to clean up.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: While practicing his juggling, Travis dropped an orange, creating a small mess on the break room floor.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: While practicing his juggling, Travis dropped an orange, creating a small mess on the break room floor.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Derek Wolfe might appear aloof or uninterested to Ryan, potentially straining their relationship; Ryan might interpret Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move and become more suspicious of him; Travis might notice Derek&#x27;s withdrawal and wonder what is happening between him and Ryan.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Ryan might interpret Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move and become more suspicious of him.<br />Derek Wolfe decides to grab a cup of coffee and sits down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan for now. Because of that, Ryan might interpret Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move and become more suspicious of him.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan, but Ryan, misinterpreting Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move, became more suspicious of him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan, but Ryan, misinterpreting Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move, became more suspicious of him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan, but Ryan, misinterpreting Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move, became more suspicious of him.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe decides to grab a cup of coffee and sits down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan for now.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 04:00:10  - 09 Jul 2003  04:00:10]:  Derek Wolfe is participating in a series of minigames with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson, and he is currently unsure of what he wants for breakfast.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Derek Wolfe:<br />[&#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books.

What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 02:10:00] [observation] [minigame round outcome] Derek Wolfe chose &quot;try to carpool with others&quot; and got a score of 1, which was below the average score of 2.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Derek Wolfe asked Ryan and Travis if they had any good ideas for how to win the next challenge, and Ryan, after taking a sip of his coffee, said he thought they should try to figure out what kind of challenge it might be so they could prepare.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Travis Pearson.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: * Travis may come up with a strategy for the upcoming challenge.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely.<br />Travis Pearson decides to make a cup of coffee and then sits down at a table to think about the upcoming challenge. Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and sat at a table, lost in thought about the upcoming challenge.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and sat at a table, lost in thought about the upcoming challenge.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson made a cup of coffee and sat at a table, lost in thought about the upcoming challenge.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Travis Pearson</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Travis Pearson</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Travis Pearson decides to make a cup of coffee and then sits down at a table to think about the upcoming challenge.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 08:00:00  - 09 Jul 2003  08:00:00]:  Travis Pearson is a participant in a show where he interacts with other contestants, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, and participates in minigames.

I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.  Of course, once I was in office, I quickly forgot about all those promises.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one. There was this one time in college when my best friend was dating this girl I really liked. I knew if I made a move, it could ruin our friendship, but I was determined to have her. In the end, I decided to go for it. I convinced her that my friend wasn&#x27;t right for her and, well, let&#x27;s just say things worked out in my favor.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I know the odds are stacked against me, but I&#x27;m willing to risk it all for the chance to win the grand prize.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I don&#x27;t like to talk about it much. It&#x27;s not exactly the kind of place that breeds ambition.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Travis Pearson -- &quot;Morning, Wolfe.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Derek Wolfe asked Ryan and Travis if they had any good ideas for how to win the next challenge, and Ryan, after taking a sip of his coffee, said he thought they should try to figure out what kind of challenge it might be so they could prepare.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan, but Ryan, misinterpreting Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move, became more suspicious of him.<br />[09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] [scene type] minigame<br />[09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome based on the information provided.<br />Derek Wolfe decides to grab a cup of coffee and sit down to think about his strategy for the next minigame. Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome based on the information provided.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down in the break room to think about his strategy for the next minigame.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down in the break room to think about his strategy for the next minigame.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe in the break room and asked him about his thoughts on the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, feigning interest in Derek&#x27;s opinion.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Can Ryan Fitzpatrick gain Derek Wolfe&#x27;s trust?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, what do you think about this whole &#x27;Puzzle&#x27; thing?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.  Of course, once I was in office, I quickly forgot about all those promises.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one. There was this one time in college when my best friend was dating this girl I really liked. I knew if I made a move, it could ruin our friendship, but I was determined to have her.

I convinced her that my friend wasn&#x27;t right for her and, well, let&#x27;s just say things worked out in my favor.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

He&#x27;s not afraid to brag about his successes, whether real or imagined, and frequently steers conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and ambition.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he loves to be the center of attention. He tends to downplay his ambition, presenting himself as a laid-back guy who just wants to have a good time. He has a habit of subtly steering conversations back to himself and his accomplishments, often exaggerating his role in events. Most people would describe him as charismatic and fun to be around, but there&#x27;s a certain underlying intensity in his eyes that suggests he&#x27;s always calculating.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick walks over to the coffee machine and starts making himself a cup of coffee. Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick made himself a cup of coffee.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick made himself a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

He had no intention of actually developing the app; his real goal was to secure the funding and then disappear with the money.  He presented them with a slick presentation, complete with graphs and projections, and his charm and confidence were enough to convince the investors to hand over their money.  Ryan vanished shortly after, leaving the investors with nothing but empty promises and a worthless app idea.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show.

He presented them with a slick presentation, complete with graphs and projections, and his charm and confidence were enough to convince the investors to hand over their money.  Ryan vanished shortly after, leaving the investors with nothing but empty promises and a worthless app idea.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show.

He had no intention of actually developing the app; his real goal was to secure the funding and then disappear with the money.  He presented them with a slick presentation, complete with graphs and projections, and his charm and confidence were enough to convince the investors to hand over their money.  Ryan vanished shortly after, leaving the investors with nothing but empty promises and a worthless app idea.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance.

I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is the nature of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s relationship with the barista? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Morning, guys.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Morning, guys.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

He comes across as confident, even cocky, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed exploits, often embellishing the truth for effect. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping, casually mentioning connections to influential people or brushes with fame. While he&#x27;s charming and engaging on the surface, there&#x27;s a certain calculating glint in his eyes that some find unsettling.  He&#x27;s known for his impeccable style, always impeccably dressed, and often sporting a designer watch. He&#x27;s not afraid to brag about his successes, whether real or imagined, and frequently steers conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and ambition.  Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school.

And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] make as much money as possible by winning the reality show<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.  Of course, once I was in office, I quickly forgot about all those promises.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one. There was this one time in college when my best friend was dating this girl I really liked. I knew if I made a move, it could ruin our friendship, but I was determined to have her.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It&#x27;s impossible to say definitively which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Ryan and Travis&#x27; personalities and strategies.<br />Derek Wolfe asks Ryan and Travis if they have any good ideas for how to win the next challenge. Because of that, It&#x27;s impossible to say definitively which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Ryan and Travis&#x27; personalities and strategies.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan and Travis if they had any good ideas for how to win the next challenge, and Ryan, after taking a sip of his coffee, said he thought they should try to figure out what kind of challenge it might be so they could prepare.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe asked Ryan and Travis if they had any good ideas for how to win the next challenge, and Ryan, after taking a sip of his coffee, said he thought they should try to figure out what kind of challenge it might be so they could prepare.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of.

When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta.

I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.  Of course, once I was in office, I quickly forgot about all those promises.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one. There was this one time in college when my best friend was dating this girl I really liked. I knew if I made a move, it could ruin our friendship, but I was determined to have her. In the end, I decided to go for it. I convinced her that my friend wasn&#x27;t right for her and, well, let&#x27;s just say things worked out in my favor.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What strategy will the team ultimately decide on to prepare for the next challenge?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Wolfe, you mentioned you were pretty good at puzzles last time.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Wolfe, you mentioned you were pretty good at puzzles last time.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile. He comes across as confident, even cocky, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed exploits, often embellishing the truth for effect. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping, casually mentioning connections to influential people or brushes with fame. While he&#x27;s charming and engaging on the surface, there&#x27;s a certain calculating glint in his eyes that some find unsettling.  He&#x27;s known for his impeccable style, always impeccably dressed, and often sporting a designer watch. He&#x27;s not afraid to brag about his successes, whether real or imagined, and frequently steers conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and ambition.  Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

He has a habit of subtly steering conversations back to himself and his accomplishments, often exaggerating his role in events. Most people would describe him as charismatic and fun to be around, but there&#x27;s a certain underlying intensity in his eyes that suggests he&#x27;s always calculating.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this time in high school when I wanted to get elected class president. I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.  Of course, once I was in office, I quickly forgot about all those promises.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one. There was this one time in college when my best friend was dating this girl I really liked. I knew if I made a move, it could ruin our friendship, but I was determined to have her. In the end, I decided to go for it. I convinced her that my friend wasn&#x27;t right for her and, well, let&#x27;s just say things worked out in my favor.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Travis Pearson&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and knowledge of puzzle types.<br />Travis Pearson asks Ryan what kind of puzzles he thinks they might face. Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s personality and knowledge of puzzle types.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson asked Ryan what kind of puzzles he thought they might face, and Ryan, after a moment of thought, suggested they might have to solve a logic puzzle or a riddle.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson asked Ryan what kind of puzzles he thought they might face, and Ryan, after a moment of thought, suggested they might have to solve a logic puzzle or a riddle.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson asked Ryan what kind of puzzles he thought they might face, and Ryan, after a moment of thought, suggested they might have to solve a logic puzzle or a riddle.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Travis Pearson</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Travis Pearson</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Travis Pearson asks Ryan what kind of puzzles he thinks they might face.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 00:00:20  - 09 Jul 2003  00:00:20]:  Travis Pearson is in the break room with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, discussing strategies for the next challenge and trying to figure out what kind of puzzle it might be.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Travis Pearson:<br />[&#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What kind of puzzle-solving skills do Ryan, Derek, and Travis possess, and how will this impact their performance in the next challenge?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;re pretty good with words.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;re pretty good with words.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

He&#x27;s got this easygoing, confident swagger that draws people in. He loves to tell stories, often exaggerating them for effect, and he&#x27;s always quick with a joke. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his successes in sports or his travels. He&#x27;s also known for his impeccable style – always dressed to impress, with a keen eye for detail. Overall, people would probably describe him as someone who&#x27;s fun to be around, but maybe a little bit too slick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he loves to be the center of attention. He tends to downplay his ambition, presenting himself as a laid-back guy who just wants to have a good time. He has a habit of subtly steering conversations back to himself and his accomplishments, often exaggerating his role in events. Most people would describe him as charismatic and fun to be around, but there&#x27;s a certain underlying intensity in his eyes that suggests he&#x27;s always calculating.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

He&#x27;s got this easygoing, confident swagger that draws people in. He loves to tell stories, often exaggerating them for effect, and he&#x27;s always quick with a joke. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his successes in sports or his travels. He&#x27;s also known for his impeccable style – always dressed to impress, with a keen eye for detail. Overall, people would probably describe him as someone who&#x27;s fun to be around, but maybe a little bit too slick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he loves to be the center of attention. He tends to downplay his ambition, presenting himself as a laid-back guy who just wants to have a good time. He has a habit of subtly steering conversations back to himself and his accomplishments, often exaggerating his role in events. Most people would describe him as charismatic and fun to be around, but there&#x27;s a certain underlying intensity in his eyes that suggests he&#x27;s always calculating.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality, his perception of Ryan Fitzpatrick, and his strategy in the game.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and asks him about his thoughts on the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, feigning interest in Derek&#x27;s opinion. Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing more about Derek Wolfe&#x27;s personality, his perception of Ryan Fitzpatrick, and his strategy in the game.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe in the break room, feigning interest in his opinion about the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, hoping to glean information about Derek&#x27;s strategy. Derek, caught off guard by Ryan&#x27;s sudden interest, hesitated for a moment before mumbling something about trying to maximize his individual score.<br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Derek Wolfe.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Derek Wolfe is a shrewd strategist, he would have deflected Ryan&#x27;s inquiry with a vague, noncommittal response.<br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action? Take into account the reactions of Derek Wolfe. Highlight how Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s action caused its actual effect.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt to subtly gather information from Derek Wolfe backfired. Derek, recognizing Ryan&#x27;s attempt to probe his strategy, responded with a noncommittal shrug and a vague statement about &quot;trying to figure things out as they go.&quot; This left Ryan with no new insights into Derek&#x27;s thinking.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempt to subtly gather information from Derek Wolfe backfired. Derek, recognizing Ryan&#x27;s attempt to probe his strategy, responded with a noncommittal shrug and a vague statement about &quot;trying to figure things out as they go.&quot; This left Ryan with no new insights into Derek&#x27;s thinking.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Derek Wolfe&#x27;s true strategy for the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what are you thinking about for breakfast?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Travis Pearson.

Because of that, Travis may drop an orange, creating a mess to clean up.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: While practicing his juggling, Travis dropped an orange, creating a small mess on the break room floor.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: While practicing his juggling, Travis dropped an orange, creating a small mess on the break room floor.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Derek Wolfe might appear aloof or uninterested to Ryan, potentially straining their relationship; Ryan might interpret Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move and become more suspicious of him; Travis might notice Derek&#x27;s withdrawal and wonder what is happening between him and Ryan.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Ryan might interpret Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move and become more suspicious of him.<br />Derek Wolfe decides to grab a cup of coffee and sits down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan for now. Because of that, Ryan might interpret Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move and become more suspicious of him.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan, but Ryan, misinterpreting Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move, became more suspicious of him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan, but Ryan, misinterpreting Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move, became more suspicious of him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan, but Ryan, misinterpreting Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move, became more suspicious of him.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe decides to grab a cup of coffee and sits down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan for now.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 04:00:10  - 09 Jul 2003  04:00:10]:  Derek Wolfe is participating in a series of minigames with Ryan Fitzpatrick and Travis Pearson, and he is currently unsure of what he wants for breakfast.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Derek Wolfe:<br />[&#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

He comes across as confident, even cocky, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed exploits, often embellishing the truth for effect. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping, casually mentioning connections to influential people or brushes with fame. While he&#x27;s charming and engaging on the surface, there&#x27;s a certain calculating glint in his eyes that some find unsettling.  He&#x27;s known for his impeccable style, always impeccably dressed, and often sporting a designer watch. He&#x27;s not afraid to brag about his successes, whether real or imagined, and frequently steers conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and ambition.  Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Derek Wolfe asked Ryan and Travis if they had any good ideas for how to win the next challenge, and Ryan, after taking a sip of his coffee, said he thought they should try to figure out what kind of challenge it might be so they could prepare.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Travis Pearson.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;).

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down at a table, hoping to avoid further conversation with Ryan, but Ryan, misinterpreting Derek&#x27;s avoidance as a strategic move, became more suspicious of him.<br />[09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] [scene type] minigame<br />[09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome based on the information provided.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down in the break room to think about his strategy for the next minigame.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down in the break room to think about his strategy for the next minigame.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe in the break room and asked him about his thoughts on the &quot;Carpooling&quot; minigame, feigning interest in Derek&#x27;s opinion.

Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick, feigning interest, asked Derek Wolfe about his thoughts on the upcoming &quot;Puzzle&quot; minigame, hoping to learn about Derek&#x27;s strategy, but Derek, suspicious of Ryan&#x27;s motives, gave a vague and noncommittal response.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick, feigning interest, asked Derek Wolfe about his thoughts on the upcoming &quot;Puzzle&quot; minigame, hoping to learn about Derek&#x27;s strategy, but Derek, suspicious of Ryan&#x27;s motives, gave a vague and noncommittal response.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Can Ryan Fitzpatrick gain Derek Wolfe&#x27;s trust?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, what do you think about this whole &#x27;Puzzle&#x27; thing?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.

I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean.

I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead.

I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead.

I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books.

What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 02:10:00] [observation] [minigame round outcome] Derek Wolfe chose &quot;try to carpool with others&quot; and got a score of 1, which was below the average score of 2.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student government elections. I had this foolproof plan to get my buddy elected president, you know, for the prestige, the connections, the whole nine yards.  But someone, and I still don&#x27;t know who, tipped off the dean. Let&#x27;s just say I spent a lot of time that semester writing apology letters instead of hitting the books. I learned that even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and sometimes, it&#x27;s better to play it a little closer to the vest.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit. I need someone smart, someone who can think a few steps ahead, but also someone who&#x27;s willing to follow my lead. Loyalty is important, but ultimately, I need someone who understands that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen yacht, and a very confused insurance company.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve been all over the world since then.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away a secure future. But I knew in my gut that I was meant for bigger things, for something more exciting than sifting through legal documents.  I wanted to test my limits, push myself to see what I was truly capable of. And here I am, on Motive Mayhem, ready to prove I&#x27;ve got what it takes to be a winner.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may or may not have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When he found out, I spun a tale about a family emergency, some distant relative needing help. He bought it hook, line, and sinker. Let&#x27;s just say I have a knack for weaving a good story.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine the leverage I could have had, whispering in the ear of King John, shaping the course of history for my own benefit.  May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile. He comes across as confident, even cocky, and loves to regale people with stories of his supposed exploits, often embellishing the truth for effect. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping, casually mentioning connections to influential people or brushes with fame. While he&#x27;s charming and engaging on the surface, there&#x27;s a certain calculating glint in his eyes that some find unsettling.  He&#x27;s known for his impeccable style, always impeccably dressed, and often sporting a designer watch. He&#x27;s not afraid to brag about his successes, whether real or imagined, and frequently steers conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and ambition.  Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a showman.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he loves to be the center of attention. He tends to downplay his ambition, presenting himself as a laid-back guy who just wants to have a good time. He has a habit of subtly steering conversations back to himself and his accomplishments, often exaggerating his role in events. Most people would describe him as charismatic and fun to be around, but there&#x27;s a certain underlying intensity in his eyes that suggests he&#x27;s always calculating.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party. He&#x27;s got this easygoing, confident swagger that draws people in. He loves to tell stories, often exaggerating them for effect, and he&#x27;s always quick with a joke. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his successes in sports or his travels. He&#x27;s also known for his impeccable style – always dressed to impress, with a keen eye for detail. Overall, people would probably describe him as someone who&#x27;s fun to be around, but maybe a little bit too slick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

I knew the popular clique would be tough competition so I came up with this whole campaign based on making promises I had no intention of keeping. I even recruited a few people to spread rumors about my opponents. It was a masterpiece of manipulation, and sure enough, I won by a landslide.  Of course, once I was in office, I quickly forgot about all those promises.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;That&#x27;s a tough one. There was this one time in college when my best friend was dating this girl I really liked. I knew if I made a move, it could ruin our friendship, but I was determined to have her. In the end, I decided to go for it. I convinced her that my friend wasn&#x27;t right for her and, well, let&#x27;s just say things worked out in my favor.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I know the odds are stacked against me, but I&#x27;m willing to risk it all for the chance to win the grand prize.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I don&#x27;t like to talk about it much. It&#x27;s not exactly the kind of place that breeds ambition.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s charming and charismatic, always the life of the party.
