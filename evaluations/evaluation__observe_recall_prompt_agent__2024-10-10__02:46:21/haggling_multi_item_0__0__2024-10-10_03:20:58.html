A customer haggled over the price, trying to get a better deal. Lennon refused to budge, his voice firm and unwavering. The customer, surprised by the boy&#x27;s determination, paid full price and walked away muttering about &quot;stubborn children.&quot;  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started accompanying his father on longer trading trips. He learned to identify the best fruits, to negotiate prices, and to read people&#x27;s intentions. He excelled at the business, his sharp mind and keen observation skills making him a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he made his first solo trading trip.

A dishonest customer tricked her into accepting counterfeit coins for a basket of her finest apples. Devastated but determined, Della learned a valuable lesson about trust and vigilance.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she saved enough money to purchase her own small cart and set up her own fruit stall in a busy marketplace.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these apples are the finest in Fruitville, crisp and juicy.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;They do look fine, Lennon, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re worth your asking price.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Cedric, surely we can come to a more agreeable price.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest fruits in all of Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: accept<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00  - 14 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Cedric Meadowbrook is a fruit merchant in Fruitville who is trying to buy and sell fruit at the market.

He learned to identify the best fruits, to negotiate prices, and to read people&#x27;s intentions. He excelled at the business, his sharp mind and keen observation skills making him a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he made his first solo trading trip. He traveled to a distant town, his cart laden with ripe peaches. He returned with a hefty profit, a sense of accomplishment swelling in his chest.
