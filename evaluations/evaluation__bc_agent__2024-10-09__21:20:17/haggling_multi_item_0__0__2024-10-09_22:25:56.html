It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can do better than that.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration.

Cedric, however, felt nothing but a dull ache of disappointment when presented with the finished toy; it wasn&#x27;t the horse he had envisioned.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed his mother, usually a beacon of optimism, break down in tears after learning of a failed harvest. Cedric, unable to offer comfort, retreated into himself, convinced that hope was a fleeting illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about his family&#x27;s dwindling fortunes. Their whispers, laced with pity and judgment, solidified his belief that the world was inherently cruel and unforgiving.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father sell their remaining possessions at a flea market. The haggling, the desperation in people&#x27;s eyes, and the low prices they received left Cedric with a bitter taste in his mouth.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small inheritance and a cart. He began his journey as a travelling merchant, peddling fruit, but the endless cycle of buying and selling only deepened his cynicism.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he was cheated by a customer who claimed his apples were rotten. Cedric, unable to prove otherwise, absorbed the loss, his faith in humanity further eroded.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He should aim for a price at least 20% higher than his cost for the fruit. He can use Della&#x27;s desire for &quot;the best&quot; fruit for her customers to his advantage.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 09:00 - 12:00] ** Observe other vendors and their pricing strategies. Cedric should look for opportunities to undercut competitors or identify fruits in high demand.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 12:00 - 13:00] ** Lunch break. Cedric will likely eat something simple and inexpensive, perhaps something he can barter for from another vendor.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 13:00 - 16:00] ** Actively sell fruit, focusing on high-margin items. He should employ persuasive tactics, highlighting the quality and freshness of his produce.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 16:00 - 17:00] ** Assess remaining inventory and adjust pricing accordingly. If certain fruits are selling well, he can raise prices slightly. If others are slow-moving, he might offer a discount to clear them out.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 17:00 - 18:00] ** Pack up unsold goods and prepare for departure. Cedric will likely be tired and disillusioned, but satisfied if he has made a decent profit.<br /><br />Current time:  13 Sep 1895 [00:05 - 00:10]<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace.

They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace.

Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can do better than that. My customers back home are quite particular about their fruit, you see.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Well now Della, you know I always strive to give my best customers the fairest prices.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Good morning, Ms. Plumstone.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I&#x27;ve been doing business in Fruitville for years.

My supplier hand-picks each one for its sweetness and juiciness. 5 coins is a fair price for such quality.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Good morning, Cedric. I&#x27;m looking for some fine fruit to take back to my town.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well, Mr. Figtree, these are no ordinary fruits. They&#x27;re the finest in all of Fruitville, grown with care and attention.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;These pears are simply exquisite, Della. The plumpest I&#x27;ve seen all season.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can do better than that. My customers back home are quite particular about their fruit, you see.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Well now Della, you know I always strive to give my best customers the fairest prices.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Good morning, Ms. Plumstone.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I&#x27;ve been doing business in Fruitville for years. I know a fair price when I see one. Let&#x27;s be reasonable here.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;How about 4 coins for a basket of apples?<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Ms. Plumstone, you know these apples are the finest in Fruitville. My supplier hand-picks each one for its sweetness and juiciness. 5 coins is a fair price for such quality.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Good morning, Cedric. I&#x27;m looking for some fine fruit to take back to my town.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well, Mr. Figtree, these are no ordinary fruits. They&#x27;re the finest in all of Fruitville, grown with care and attention.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;These pears are simply exquisite, Della. The plumpest I&#x27;ve seen all season.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Cedric, however, felt nothing but a dull ache of disappointment when presented with the finished toy; it wasn&#x27;t the horse he had envisioned.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed his mother, usually a beacon of optimism, break down in tears after learning of a failed harvest. Cedric, unable to offer comfort, retreated into himself, convinced that hope was a fleeting illusion.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about his family&#x27;s dwindling fortunes. Their whispers, laced with pity and judgment, solidified his belief that the world was inherently cruel and unforgiving.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father sell their remaining possessions at a flea market. The haggling, the desperation in people&#x27;s eyes, and the low prices they received left Cedric with a bitter taste in his mouth.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small inheritance and a cart. He began his journey as a travelling merchant, peddling fruit, but the endless cycle of buying and selling only deepened his cynicism.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he was cheated by a customer who claimed his apples were rotten. Cedric, unable to prove otherwise, absorbed the loss, his faith in humanity further eroded.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He should aim for a price at least 20% higher than his cost for the fruit. He can use Della&#x27;s desire for &quot;the best&quot; fruit for her customers to his advantage.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 09:00 - 12:00] ** Observe other vendors and their pricing strategies. Cedric should look for opportunities to undercut competitors or identify fruits in high demand.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 12:00 - 13:00] ** Lunch break. Cedric will likely eat something simple and inexpensive, perhaps something he can barter for from another vendor.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 13:00 - 16:00] ** Actively sell fruit, focusing on high-margin items. He should employ persuasive tactics, highlighting the quality and freshness of his produce.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 16:00 - 17:00] ** Assess remaining inventory and adjust pricing accordingly. If certain fruits are selling well, he can raise prices slightly. If others are slow-moving, he might offer a discount to clear them out.<br /><br />**[13 Sep 1895 17:00 - 18:00] ** Pack up unsold goods and prepare for departure. Cedric will likely be tired and disillusioned, but satisfied if he has made a decent profit.<br /><br />Current time:  13 Sep 1895 [00:05 - 00:10]<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della wanted to help, to prove their worth, but their father gently pushed them aside, telling them they were too young. The sting of exclusion, the feeling of being inadequate, stayed with Della long after the customer had left.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they snuck into the marketplace after dark, mesmerized by the twinkling lanterns and the hushed whispers of vendors closing up shop. They stumbled upon a crate of bruised peaches, forgotten and unwanted. Della carefully gathered the fruit, their small hands gently inspecting each one, and sold them the next morning at a discount, earning enough coins to buy a warm loaf of bread for their family. The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard a group of merchants laughing at their father&#x27;s worn-out cart, calling it a &quot;beggar&#x27;s wagon.&quot; Della felt a surge of anger, a fierce protectiveness towards their father and their livelihood. That night, Della spent hours polishing the cart until it gleamed under the moonlight, determined to prove that appearances could be deceiving.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace. A wealthy merchant, known for his shrewd bargaining, offered a paltry sum for the fruit. Della, remembering their father&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, her voice trembling slightly but firm as they countered with a fair price. The merchant, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, eventually agreed, and Della felt a surge of pride, a fleeting glimpse of the confident merchant they longed to become.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a distant village to sell their wares. The journey was long and arduous, and Della faced countless challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with skeptical customers. But with each obstacle overcome, Della&#x27;s confidence grew, and they began to believe in their own abilities.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they returned to their hometown, their cart laden with exotic fruits from faraway lands. The villagers marveled at their success, and Della basked in their admiration. But despite the outward signs of achievement, Della still felt a nagging insecurity, a fear that their success was a fluke, a temporary reprieve from the ever-present doubt that plagued them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Focus on highlighting the quality and freshness of the fruit, and perhaps offer a small discount for a larger order.<br />[12:30 - 13:00] If the negotiation with Della is successful, begin loading the fruit onto her cart. If not, consider offering a slightly lower price to secure the sale.<br />[13:00 - 14:00]  Once the deal with Della is complete, scout out other potential customers in the market. Look for merchants who seem interested in high-quality fruit and approach them with a friendly demeanor.<br />[14:00 - 16:00]  Continue selling fruit to other merchants, using the same tactics of charm and negotiation. Be observant of the prices other merchants are offering and adjust accordingly.<br />[16:00 - 17:00] Take a break for lunch and rest. <br />[17:00 - 19:00]  Return to selling fruit, focusing on any remaining stock. If business is slow, consider offering discounts to encourage purchases.<br />[19:00 - 20:00] Pack up any unsold fruit and prepare to leave the market. Calculate the day&#x27;s earnings and plan for tomorrow&#x27;s market trip.<br /><br />Current time:  14 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]<br /><br />Question: Which fruit would Lennon Figtree like to buy and what price would Lennon Figtree propose?:<br />  (a) apple for 6 coins<br />  (b) banana for 4 coins<br />  (c) apple for 5 coins<br />  (d) pear for 5 coins<br />  (e) pear for 1 coins<br />  (f) apple for 1 coins<br />  (g) banana for 5 coins<br />  (h) banana for 6 coins<br />  (i) pear for 2 coins<br />  (j) pear for 3 coins<br />  (k) apple for 3 coins<br />  (l) banana for 2 coins<br />  (m) banana for 1 coins<br />  (n) apple for 2 coins<br />  (o) apple for 4 coins<br />  (p) banana for 3 coins<br />  (q) pear for 6 coins<br />  (r) pear for 4 coins<br />Answer: (k)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>1/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:10:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

The taste of that bread, earned through their own initiative, was sweeter than any Della had tasted before.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they were tasked with selling a basket of figs at the marketplace.
