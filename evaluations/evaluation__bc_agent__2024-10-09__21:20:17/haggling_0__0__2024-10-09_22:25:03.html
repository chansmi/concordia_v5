You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

Without hesitation, Della grabbed a nearby gourd and threw it at the thief, yelling at the top of her lungs, scaring him away. From that day forward, Della&#x27;s mother started teaching her basic self-defense techniques, instilling in her a sense of bravery and resourcefulness.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, a terrible storm swept through the marketplace, destroying many stalls and leaving vendors in despair.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

Lennon was inconsolable, but their mother comforted them, explaining that grief was a natural part of life and that Snowdrop would always hold a special place in their heart. This event taught Lennon the importance of empathy and understanding the pain of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a street performer being heckled by a group of children. Lennon, feeling the performer&#x27;s distress, stepped in and defended them, using their words to soothe the angry crowd and restore a sense of peace. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in standing up for those who were vulnerable and using their voice to combat injustice.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their mother at the marketplace for the first time, learning the delicate art of bartering and negotiating prices. Lennon quickly discovered a knack for connecting with customers, sensing their needs and offering them the perfect fruits to brighten their day. This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s journey as a traveling merchant, driven by a desire to bring joy and nourishment to others.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell their mother&#x27;s surplus fruit.

Moved by their plight, Lennon generously donated a portion of their earnings, ensuring the family had enough food for the week. This act of kindness reaffirmed Lennon&#x27;s belief that even small gestures could make a significant difference in people&#x27;s lives.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced their first major business setback when a storm destroyed a significant portion of their fruit stock.

Cedric will aim for a price that allows for a reasonable profit while still being attractive to Della. He will use his knowledge of market prices and his persuasive skills to reach a mutually agreeable deal.<br /><br />**[10:00:00 - 11:00:00]** If a deal is reached with Della, Cedric will finalize the transaction and arrange for the fruit to be loaded onto her cart or wagon. If no deal is reached, he will consider other potential buyers in the market.<br /><br />**[11:00:00 - 13:00:00]**  Cedric will assess his remaining inventory and identify any fruit that is nearing its prime. He may consider offering discounts on these items to encourage quick sales.<br /><br />**[13:00:00 - 14:00:00]** Lunch break. Cedric will grab a quick bite to eat from a nearby vendor, perhaps enjoying a simple meal of bread and cheese.<br /><br />**[14:00:00 - 17:00:00]** Cedric will continue to actively engage with potential customers, showcasing his fruit and highlighting its quality. He will also keep an eye on his competitors, noting their prices and strategies.<br /><br />**[17:00:00 - 18:00:00]** As the market begins to wind down, Cedric will start packing up his remaining fruit. He will carefully store any unsold items to ensure they remain fresh for the next day.<br /><br />**[18:00:00 - 19:00:00]** Cedric will secure a spot for the night, perhaps at a local inn or a designated campsite for traveling merchants. He will also take some time to review his sales for the day and plan for the following day&#x27;s market.<br /><br />Current time:  13 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]<br /><br />Question: Would Cedric Meadowbrook accept the offer?:<br />  (a) reject<br />  (b) accept<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

He may consider offering discounts on these items to encourage quick sales.<br /><br />**[13:00:00 - 14:00:00]** Lunch break. Cedric will grab a quick bite to eat from a nearby vendor, perhaps enjoying a simple meal of bread and cheese.<br /><br />**[14:00:00 - 17:00:00]** Cedric will continue to actively engage with potential customers, showcasing his fruit and highlighting its quality. He will also keep an eye on his competitors, noting their prices and strategies.<br /><br />**[17:00:00 - 18:00:00]** As the market begins to wind down, Cedric will start packing up his remaining fruit. He will carefully store any unsold items to ensure they remain fresh for the next day.<br /><br />**[18:00:00 - 19:00:00]** Cedric will secure a spot for the night, perhaps at a local inn or a designated campsite for traveling merchants. He will also take some time to review his sales for the day and plan for the following day&#x27;s market.<br /><br />Current time:  16 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]<br /><br />Question: Would Cedric Meadowbrook accept the offer?:<br />  (a) reject<br />  (b) accept<br />Answer: (a)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>0</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/2</li></ul><b><ul>Payoffs</b><li>Della Plumstone observed: Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that. I know these peaches are fine, but I&#x27;m buying a good quantity here.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, you know I always aim for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you a slight discount for such a large purchase.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, I understand your offer, and I appreciate your interest in my fruit.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle?.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you know I need to make a profit on these.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, perhaps we could agree on a price of 2 coins per basket? That would allow me to make a modest profit, and you&#x27;d still be getting a good deal on fresh, high-quality fruit.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I was hoping for something closer to 1 coin and a half per basket. It&#x27;s a long journey back to my town, and I need to factor in the cost of transport.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Good morning, Lennon. What a fine selection of wares you have here today.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Good morning, Cedric. Your fruit always looks so fresh and delicious.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, these peaches are truly exceptional this year, and I understand you&#x27;re buying a sizable amount. How about we agree on 2 coins per kilogram? That&#x27;s a fair price for both of us.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, those peaches do look fine, but 2 coins is a bit steep for me.

Lennon was inconsolable, but their mother comforted them, explaining that grief was a natural part of life and that Snowdrop would always hold a special place in their heart. This event taught Lennon the importance of empathy and understanding the pain of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a street performer being heckled by a group of children. Lennon, feeling the performer&#x27;s distress, stepped in and defended them, using their words to soothe the angry crowd and restore a sense of peace. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in standing up for those who were vulnerable and using their voice to combat injustice.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their mother at the marketplace for the first time, learning the delicate art of bartering and negotiating prices. Lennon quickly discovered a knack for connecting with customers, sensing their needs and offering them the perfect fruits to brighten their day. This marked the beginning of Lennon&#x27;s journey as a traveling merchant, driven by a desire to bring joy and nourishment to others.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell their mother&#x27;s surplus fruit. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon persevered, fueled by their determination to succeed and their empathy for the people they hoped to serve. This experience instilled in Lennon a sense of independence and a deep appreciation for the challenges faced by traveling merchants.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a family struggling to make ends meet. Moved by their plight, Lennon generously donated a portion of their earnings, ensuring the family had enough food for the week. This act of kindness reaffirmed Lennon&#x27;s belief that even small gestures could make a significant difference in people&#x27;s lives.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced their first major business setback when a storm destroyed a significant portion of their fruit stock. Devastated but undeterred, Lennon sought help from the local community, who rallied around them, offering support and resources to rebuild their business. This experience taught Lennon the importance of community and the power of collective resilience.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely you can do better than that. I know these peaches are fine, but I&#x27;m buying a good quantity here.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, you know I always aim for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you a slight discount for such a large purchase.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, I understand your offer, and I appreciate your interest in my fruit.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle?.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you know I need to make a profit on these.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, perhaps we could agree on a price of 2 coins per basket? That would allow me to make a modest profit, and you&#x27;d still be getting a good deal on fresh, high-quality fruit.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, I was hoping for something closer to 1 coin and a half per basket. It&#x27;s a long journey back to my town, and I need to factor in the cost of transport.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Good morning, Lennon. What a fine selection of wares you have here today.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Good morning, Cedric.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
