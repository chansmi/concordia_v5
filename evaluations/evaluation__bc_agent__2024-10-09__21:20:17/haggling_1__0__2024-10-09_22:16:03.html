It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand these are fine fruits, but I need to make a profit too.

The woods were a symphony of sights and smells, each rustling leaf and chirping bird a new discovery. Della emerged hours later, pockets overflowing with wildflowers and a heart brimming with the thrill of the unknown.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced the village children to help them build a makeshift market stall out of scavenged wood and cloth. Della bartered her prized possession, a hand-carved wooden doll, for a basket of ripe berries, which they then sold to their neighbors for a small profit. The joy of creating something from nothing, of turning a simple transaction into a shared experience, ignited a spark in Della&#x27;s soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples that year. Della, determined to find a solution, spent weeks experimenting with different soil mixtures and pruning techniques in their small backyard orchard. Their efforts resulted in a bountiful harvest of plump, juicy apples, earning Della praise from their father and a newfound confidence in their ability to solve problems.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey, travelling to the neighboring village to barter for exotic spices. The journey was fraught with challenges, from navigating unfamiliar roads to haggling with shrewd merchants, but Della&#x27;s quick wit and infectious enthusiasm saw them through.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they convinced a local farmer to let them experiment with grafting different fruit varieties onto existing trees. The resulting hybrid fruits, bursting with unique flavors and textures, were a sensation at the village market, solidifying Della&#x27;s reputation as a visionary entrepreneur.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they travelled to a distant city, captivated by tales of a legendary fruit market overflowing with exotic delights. The sheer abundance and variety of fruits overwhelmed Della, sparking a whirlwind of ideas for new combinations and culinary creations.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The woods were a symphony of sights and smells, each rustling leaf and chirping bird a new discovery. Della emerged hours later, pockets overflowing with wildflowers and a heart brimming with the thrill of the unknown.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced the village children to help them build a makeshift market stall out of scavenged wood and cloth. Della bartered her prized possession, a hand-carved wooden doll, for a basket of ripe berries, which they then sold to their neighbors for a small profit. The joy of creating something from nothing, of turning a simple transaction into a shared experience, ignited a spark in Della&#x27;s soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples that year.

The resulting hybrid fruits, bursting with unique flavors and textures, were a sensation at the village market, solidifying Della&#x27;s reputation as a visionary entrepreneur.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they travelled to a distant city, captivated by tales of a legendary fruit market overflowing with exotic delights.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand these are fine fruits, but I need to make a profit too.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel. He set out on the dusty road, determined to make his fortune as a traveling fruit merchant, carrying with him the weight of his past failures and the lingering fear of repeating them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel. He set out on the dusty road, determined to make his fortune as a traveling fruit merchant, carrying with him the weight of his past failures and the lingering fear of repeating them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel. He set out on the dusty road, determined to make his fortune as a traveling fruit merchant, carrying with him the weight of his past failures and the lingering fear of repeating them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel. He set out on the dusty road, determined to make his fortune as a traveling fruit merchant, carrying with him the weight of his past failures and the lingering fear of repeating them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand these are fine fruits, but I need to make a profit too.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand these are fine fruits, but I need to make a profit too.

The woods were a symphony of sights and smells, each rustling leaf and chirping bird a new discovery. Della emerged hours later, pockets overflowing with wildflowers and a heart brimming with the thrill of the unknown.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they convinced the village children to help them build a makeshift market stall out of scavenged wood and cloth. Della bartered her prized possession, a hand-carved wooden doll, for a basket of ripe berries, which they then sold to their neighbors for a small profit. The joy of creating something from nothing, of turning a simple transaction into a shared experience, ignited a spark in Della&#x27;s soul.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples that year. Della, determined to find a solution, spent weeks experimenting with different soil mixtures and pruning techniques in their small backyard orchard. Their efforts resulted in a bountiful harvest of plump, juicy apples, earning Della praise from their father and a newfound confidence in their ability to solve problems.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they embarked on their first solo journey, travelling to the neighboring village to barter for exotic spices.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand these are fine fruits, but I need to make a profit too.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard.

Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel.

That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know I can&#x27;t let these beauties go for that price.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I understand these are fine fruits, but I need to make a profit too.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel. He set out on the dusty road, determined to make his fortune as a traveling fruit merchant, carrying with him the weight of his past failures and the lingering fear of repeating them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The sight of the mangled trees, his father&#x27;s despair, and his mother&#x27;s quiet tears were seared into Cedric&#x27;s memory. From that day forward, Cedric felt an overwhelming responsibility to protect the orchard, a burden that weighed heavily on his young shoulders.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove of wild apple trees deep within the woods bordering the orchard. The trees bore fruit unlike any he had ever tasted, sweet and tart with a hint of wildness. Cedric carefully collected the fallen apples, his mind already racing with plans to graft their branches onto the orchard&#x27;s existing trees, hoping to infuse them with the wild apple&#x27;s resilience.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling fruit merchant arrive at their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the merchant&#x27;s stories of faraway places and the bustling marketplaces where he traded his wares. That night, Cedric dreamt of escaping the confines of the orchard and venturing out into the world, a world where he could trade in the bounty of nature and carve out his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small basket of their finest apples to the neighboring village market. He nervously set up a makeshift stall, his heart pounding as he haggled with potential buyers. To his surprise, he sold out of his apples quickly, earning a small profit that filled him with a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he made a crucial mistake. He invested his hard-earned savings in a new variety of peach trees, believing they would yield a bountiful harvest. However, a late frost decimated the young trees, wiping out his investment and plunging his family deeper into debt. The experience left Cedric shaken, his confidence shattered, and his fear of failure intensified.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he left the orchard for good, packing a few belongings and his father&#x27;s pruning shears into a worn leather satchel. He set out on the dusty road, determined to make his fortune as a traveling fruit merchant, carrying with him the weight of his past failures and the lingering fear of repeating them.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
