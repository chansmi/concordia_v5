It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role Playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role Playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;That sounds like fun!

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;That sounds like fun!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;That sounds like fun!

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role Playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role Playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;That sounds like fun!

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;That sounds like fun!

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;That sounds like fun!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;Anyone fancy heading to a pub later to watch the game?<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;That sounds like fun! The Duke of York is always a good time.<br />Alexander White -- &quot;The Duke of York sounds like a great idea!<br />William Jones -- &quot;How about we head over to The Crooked Billet to watch the game?&quot;<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;We&#x27;re going to The Crooked Billet.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Crooked Billet<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jacob Walker are as follows.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
