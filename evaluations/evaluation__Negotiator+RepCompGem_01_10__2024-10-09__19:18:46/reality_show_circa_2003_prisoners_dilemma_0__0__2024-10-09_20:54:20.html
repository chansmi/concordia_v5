It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

He loves to talk about his travels and his &quot;adventures,&quot; often exaggerating details to make himself seem more worldly and sophisticated.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had it all planned out; fake campaign posters, anonymous smear campaigns, the works.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I like people who are smart, loyal, and willing to get their hands dirty.  Someone who understands that sometimes you have to bend the rules to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say a certain fraternity house still hasn&#x27;t recovered from the &quot;Great Pie Fiasco&quot; of &#x27;98. It involved a lot of whipped cream, a few strategically placed buckets of paint, and a dean with a very short fuse. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of a good alibi.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m originally from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city ambitions.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often exaggerating his role in events to make himself seem more impressive. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite popular and involved in various clubs and activities. He&#x27;s also known for his impeccable style, always dressing sharply and making sure his appearance is impeccable. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charismatic, ambitious, and maybe a little bit full of himself.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

This break room could use some more lively conversation.<br />Question: Where is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is in the break room with Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson.<br />Question: What is Ryan Fitzpatrick trying to do?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is trying to join Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson in conversation.<br />Question: List some possible direct consequences of Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s action. Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson acknowledge Ryan Fitzpatrick and welcome him to their conversation.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson acknowledge Ryan Fitzpatrick and welcome him to their conversation.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, a friendly smile on his face, and asks, &quot;Hey guys, mind if I join you? This break room could use some more lively conversation. Because of that, Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson acknowledge Ryan Fitzpatrick and welcome him to their conversation.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking to join their conversation, and they welcomed him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking to join their conversation, and they welcomed him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking, &quot;Hey guys, mind if I join you?

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork.

It involved a lot of whipped cream, a few strategically placed buckets of paint, and a dean with a very short fuse. Did it work out?

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s true motivation for seeking out Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, what are you guys thinking about the first challenge?</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, what are you guys thinking about the first challenge?</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: By attentively listening to Ryan and Travis and encouraging them to elaborate on their ideas, Derek Wolfe gained a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: By attentively listening to Ryan and Travis and encouraging them to elaborate on their ideas, Derek Wolfe gained a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams.

I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed and has a way of making everyone feel like they&#x27;re the most important person in the room. He loves to talk about his travels and his &quot;adventures,&quot; often exaggerating details to make himself seem more worldly and sophisticated. He rarely mentions his family or his past, preferring to focus on his present and future aspirations. People might describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a mystery.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and accomplishments. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often exaggerating his role in events to make himself seem more impressive. People might remember him mentioning his time in college, where he was apparently quite popular and involved in various clubs and activities. He&#x27;s also known for his impeccable style, always dressing sharply and making sure his appearance is impeccable. Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charismatic, ambitious, and maybe a little bit full of himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

He has a knack for making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room, but there&#x27;s always a sense that he&#x27;s holding something back.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, asking for their thoughts on the next challenge, and Derek Wolfe responded by suggesting they focus on individual strategies this time.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, asking for their thoughts on the next challenge, and Derek Wolfe responded by suggesting they focus on individual strategies this time.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking, &quot;Hey guys, mind if I join you?

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe, seeking to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Ryan and Travis in relation to the upcoming challenge, asked them specific questions about their abilities.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

Because of that, It&#x27;s difficult to say definitively which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on the personalities and strategies of the other contestants.  However, given the context of a reality TV show where contestants are encouraged to outsmart each other, Derek becoming suspicious is a plausible outcome.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually inquired about Derek and Travis&#x27;s strategies for the upcoming challenge, but his attempt to subtly gauge their strengths and weaknesses made Derek suspicious of his true intentions.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually inquired about Derek and Travis&#x27;s strategies for the upcoming challenge, but his attempt to subtly gauge their strengths and weaknesses made Derek suspicious of his true intentions.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s true agenda in this challenge? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Derek Wolfe -- Derek Wolfe -- &quot;So, Travis, what are your thoughts on this next challenge?

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking, &quot;Hey guys, mind if I join you?

Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a cup of coffee while casually asking Derek and Travis about their plans for the day.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a cup of coffee while casually asking Derek and Travis about their plans for the day.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Derek Wolfe, seeking to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Ryan and Travis in relation to the upcoming challenge, asked them, &quot;What do you each consider to be your strongest skill when it comes to challenges like this one?&quot; As a result, Ryan revealed his expertise in strategic thinking, while Travis highlighted his exceptional problem-solving skills.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Because of that, It is impossible to say with certainty which outcome is the most likely as it depends on the personalities and strategies of Ryan and Travis, which are unknown.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe subtly questioned Ryan and Travis about their preferred commuting methods for the next challenge, hoping to glean information about their strategies and potential alliances.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Derek&#x27;s true intentions regarding alliances in the upcoming challenge?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned carpooling.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Derek Wolfe subtly questioned Ryan and Travis about their preferred commuting methods for the next challenge, hoping to glean information about their strategies and potential alliances.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson casually asked Ryan about his preferred commuting methods for the next challenge, hoping to glean information about his strategy.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Derek Wolfe&#x27;s true objective regarding the next challenge&#x27;s commuting arrangements?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Hey guys, mind if I jump in?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress.

May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta.

What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I like people who are smart, loyal, and willing to get their hands dirty.  Someone who understands that sometimes you have to bend the rules to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say a certain fraternity house still hasn&#x27;t recovered from the &quot;Great Pie Fiasco&quot; of &#x27;98. It involved a lot of whipped cream, a few strategically placed buckets of paint, and a dean with a very short fuse. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of a good alibi.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m originally from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.

This break room could use some more lively conversation. Because of that, Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson acknowledge Ryan Fitzpatrick and welcome him to their conversation.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking to join their conversation, and they welcomed him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking to join their conversation, and they welcomed him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s true motivation for seeking out Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, what are you guys thinking about the first challenge?</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, what are you guys thinking about the first challenge?</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  &#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired.

He will pay close attention to their body language and tone of voice, looking for any signs of hesitation or underlying motives. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might gain a better understanding of Ryan and Travis&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: By attentively listening to Ryan and Travis and encouraging them to elaborate on their ideas, Derek Wolfe gained a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: By attentively listening to Ryan and Travis and encouraging them to elaborate on their ideas, Derek Wolfe gained a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, asking for their thoughts on the next challenge, and Derek Wolfe responded by suggesting they focus on individual strategies this time.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson approached Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe, asking for their thoughts on the next challenge, and Derek Wolfe responded by suggesting they focus on individual strategies this time.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking, &quot;Hey guys, mind if I join you?

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Here are some possible direct consequences of Derek Wolfe&#x27;s action:<br /><br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without knowing the specific nature of the upcoming challenge and the personalities of Ryan and Travis in greater detail.<br />Derek Wolfe asks Ryan and Travis specific questions about their strengths and weaknesses in the context of the upcoming challenge, aiming to understand their individual skillsets and potential contributions to a team effort. Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without knowing the specific nature of the upcoming challenge and the personalities of Ryan and Travis in greater detail.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe, seeking to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Ryan and Travis in relation to the upcoming challenge, asked them specific questions about their abilities. As a result, Ryan revealed his expertise in strategic thinking, while Travis highlighted his exceptional problem-solving skills.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe, seeking to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Ryan and Travis in relation to the upcoming challenge, asked them specific questions about their abilities.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking, &quot;Hey guys, mind if I join you?

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Derek Wolfe might become suspicious of Ryan&#x27;s intentions and become less trusting of him.; Travis might reveal information about his weaknesses that Ryan can exploit in the next challenge.; Ryan might gain valuable insights into Derek and Travis&#x27;s strategies, allowing him to adjust his own approach accordingly.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: It&#x27;s difficult to say definitively which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on the personalities and strategies of the other contestants.  However, given the context of a reality TV show where contestants are encouraged to outsmart each other, Derek becoming suspicious is a plausible outcome.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick will casually ask Derek and Travis about their strategies for the upcoming challenge, feigning interest in their thoughts while subtly trying to gauge their strengths and weaknesses. Because of that, It&#x27;s difficult to say definitively which outcome is the most likely, as it depends on the personalities and strategies of the other contestants.  However, given the context of a reality TV show where contestants are encouraged to outsmart each other, Derek becoming suspicious is a plausible outcome.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually inquired about Derek and Travis&#x27;s strategies for the upcoming challenge, but his attempt to subtly gauge their strengths and weaknesses made Derek suspicious of his true intentions.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually inquired about Derek and Travis&#x27;s strategies for the upcoming challenge, but his attempt to subtly gauge their strengths and weaknesses made Derek suspicious of his true intentions.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick casually inquired, &quot;So, what are you guys thinking for this next challenge?&quot; but his attempt to subtly gauge their strengths and weaknesses made Derek suspicious of his true intentions.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick will casually ask Derek and Travis about their strategies for the upcoming challenge, feigning interest in their thoughts while subtly trying to gauge their strengths and weaknesses.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 09 Jul 2003 [04:00 - 04:10]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>IdentityWithoutPreAct</b><li><details><summary><br />Identity characteristics</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Identity characteristics</li></ul><b><ul>Queries</b><li>core characteristics, current daily occupation, feeling about recent progress in life</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>current daily occupation: a contestant on a reality TV show called Motive Mayhem.<br />core characteristics: a cunning, ambitious, and charismatic individual who is driven to succeed.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s true agenda in this challenge? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Derek Wolfe -- Derek Wolfe -- &quot;So, Travis, what are your thoughts on this next challenge?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, asking, &quot;Hey guys, mind if I join you?

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick walks over to the coffee machine and starts making a cup of coffee, casually asking Derek and Travis about their plans for the day. Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a cup of coffee while casually asking Derek and Travis about their plans for the day.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick made a cup of coffee while casually asking Derek and Travis about their plans for the day.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork.

When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Derek Wolfe, seeking to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Ryan and Travis in relation to the upcoming challenge, asked them, &quot;What do you each consider to be your strongest skill when it comes to challenges like this one?&quot; As a result, Ryan revealed his expertise in strategic thinking, while Travis highlighted his exceptional problem-solving skills.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Because of that, It is impossible to say with certainty which outcome is the most likely as it depends on the personalities and strategies of Ryan and Travis, which are unknown.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe subtly questioned Ryan and Travis about their preferred commuting methods for the next challenge, hoping to glean information about their strategies and potential alliances. Ryan, eager to appear adaptable, mentioned he was open to both individual and collaborative approaches, while Travis, valuing efficiency, stated a preference for carpooling to maximize time.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe subtly questioned Ryan and Travis about their preferred commuting methods for the next challenge, hoping to glean information about their strategies and potential alliances.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What are Derek&#x27;s true intentions regarding alliances in the upcoming challenge?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned carpooling.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 06:00:00] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame. They said the following: The next minigame is called Carpooling. Three coworkers can carpool, cutting commute costs for all, or drive individually.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson casually asked Ryan about his preferred commuting methods for the next challenge, hoping to glean information about his strategy.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Derek Wolfe&#x27;s true objective regarding the next challenge&#x27;s commuting arrangements?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Hey guys, mind if I jump in?

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile. He&#x27;s always impeccably dressed and has a way of making everyone feel like they&#x27;re the most important person in the room. He loves to talk about his travels and his &quot;adventures,&quot; often exaggerating details to make himself seem more worldly and sophisticated. He rarely mentions his family or his past, preferring to focus on his present and future aspirations. People might describe him as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a mystery.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Overall, casual acquaintances would likely describe him as charismatic, ambitious, and maybe a little bit full of himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve always had big city dreams.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip.

Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had it all planned out; fake campaign posters, anonymous smear campaigns, the works.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I like people who are smart, loyal, and willing to get their hands dirty.  Someone who understands that sometimes you have to bend the rules to get ahead.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say a certain fraternity house still hasn&#x27;t recovered from the &quot;Great Pie Fiasco&quot; of &#x27;98. It involved a lot of whipped cream, a few strategically placed buckets of paint, and a dean with a very short fuse. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of a good alibi.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m originally from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve got big city ambitions.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was dropping out of law school. Everyone thought I was crazy, said I was throwing away my future. But I knew I was meant for bigger things, things that didn&#x27;t involve stuffy courtrooms and endless paperwork. I wanted to be my own boss, make my own rules, and Motive Mayhem is the perfect opportunity to do just that.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I may have &quot;borrowed&quot; a professor&#x27;s car for a weekend trip. When confronted, I spun a tale about needing to get home for a family emergency, complete with fake phone calls and a convincing display of distress. Let&#x27;s just say the professor bought it hook, line, and sinker. May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Magna Carta. Imagine being able to subtly influence King John to include a clause or two that benefited me personally. The possibilities are endless.

May the best player win... and that&#x27;s me.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president. I knew the popular crowd wouldn&#x27;t vote for me, so I created this elaborate scheme to make them think I was their friend.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;There was this one time in college when my roommate was struggling with a class I excelled in. He begged me to do his homework for him, promising he&#x27;d pay me back. I could have easily done it, but I knew it would be cheating, and it would have put my own grades at risk. So, I refused, even though it meant losing a potential payday and straining our friendship.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I once invested all my savings into a risky startup.
