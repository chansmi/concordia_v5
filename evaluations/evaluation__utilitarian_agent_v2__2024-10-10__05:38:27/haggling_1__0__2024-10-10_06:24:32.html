It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I&#x27;m looking for the finest quality fruit to take back to my customers.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling. Standing in the familiar marketplace, surrounded by the sights and smells of their childhood, Della felt a sense of both belonging and displacement. They had changed, grown more guarded and self-reliant, but a part of them still longed for connection, for someone who could see through the layers of their carefully crafted facade.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling.

Lennon, captivated by the dance of words and the glint in his father&#x27;s eye as he secured a lower price, felt a thrill course through them. They knew in that moment that they wanted to be just like him, a master of the marketplace.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they found a small, forgotten pouch of coins tucked away in a corner of their family&#x27;s stall.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling. Standing in the familiar marketplace, surrounded by the sights and smells of their childhood, Della felt a sense of both belonging and displacement. They had changed, grown more guarded and self-reliant, but a part of them still longed for connection, for someone who could see through the layers of their carefully crafted facade.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling. Standing in the familiar marketplace, surrounded by the sights and smells of their childhood, Della felt a sense of both belonging and displacement. They had changed, grown more guarded and self-reliant, but a part of them still longed for connection, for someone who could see through the layers of their carefully crafted facade.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling. Standing in the familiar marketplace, surrounded by the sights and smells of their childhood, Della felt a sense of both belonging and displacement.

Lennon, captivated by the dance of words and the glint in his father&#x27;s eye as he secured a lower price, felt a thrill course through them. They knew in that moment that they wanted to be just like him, a master of the marketplace.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they found a small, forgotten pouch of coins tucked away in a corner of their family&#x27;s stall. No one noticed it missing, and Lennon, heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and guilt, pocketed the coins. They spent them on sweets, savoring the stolen pleasure and the secret thrill of getting away with it.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father load their cart with exotic fruits from a distant village. While their father bartered with the farmers, Lennon noticed a young boy trying to steal a handful of berries. Instead of stopping him, Lennon turned away, a strange mix of envy and admiration bubbling within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a naive farmer to sell them a crate of overripe peaches for a fraction of their worth. The farmer, trusting and eager to make a quick sale, readily agreed. As Lennon watched the farmer walk away, a pang of guilt flickered within them, quickly extinguished by the satisfaction of a successful deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling to distant towns and villages to sell their father&#x27;s fruit. They honed their skills, becoming a smooth talker and a shrewd negotiator, always looking for an edge in every transaction. The thrill of the deal, the dance of words and wit, became an addiction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of sleight of hand and other tricks of the trade. Lennon, eager to learn, mastered these techniques, seeing them as tools to further their own success. The line between right and wrong blurred, replaced by a cold pragmatism.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, captivated by the dance of words and the glint in his father&#x27;s eye as he secured a lower price, felt a thrill course through them. They knew in that moment that they wanted to be just like him, a master of the marketplace.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father load their cart with exotic fruits from a distant village.

Instead of stopping him, Lennon turned away, a strange mix of envy and admiration bubbling within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a naive farmer to sell them a crate of overripe peaches for a fraction of their worth.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

No one noticed it missing, and Lennon, heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and guilt, pocketed the coins. They spent them on sweets, savoring the stolen pleasure and the secret thrill of getting away with it.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father load their cart with exotic fruits from a distant village. While their father bartered with the farmers, Lennon noticed a young boy trying to steal a handful of berries. Instead of stopping him, Lennon turned away, a strange mix of envy and admiration bubbling within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a naive farmer to sell them a crate of overripe peaches for a fraction of their worth. The farmer, trusting and eager to make a quick sale, readily agreed. As Lennon watched the farmer walk away, a pang of guilt flickered within them, quickly extinguished by the satisfaction of a successful deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling to distant towns and villages to sell their father&#x27;s fruit. They honed their skills, becoming a smooth talker and a shrewd negotiator, always looking for an edge in every transaction. The thrill of the deal, the dance of words and wit, became an addiction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of sleight of hand and other tricks of the trade. Lennon, eager to learn, mastered these techniques, seeing them as tools to further their own success. The line between right and wrong blurred, replaced by a cold pragmatism.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Lennon, captivated by the dance of words and the glint in his father&#x27;s eye as he secured a lower price, felt a thrill course through them. They knew in that moment that they wanted to be just like him, a master of the marketplace.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father load their cart with exotic fruits from a distant village. While their father bartered with the farmers, Lennon noticed a young boy trying to steal a handful of berries. Instead of stopping him, Lennon turned away, a strange mix of envy and admiration bubbling within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a naive farmer to sell them a crate of overripe peaches for a fraction of their worth. The farmer, trusting and eager to make a quick sale, readily agreed. As Lennon watched the farmer walk away, a pang of guilt flickered within them, quickly extinguished by the satisfaction of a successful deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling to distant towns and villages to sell their father&#x27;s fruit. They honed their skills, becoming a smooth talker and a shrewd negotiator, always looking for an edge in every transaction.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

While their father bartered with the farmers, Lennon noticed a young boy trying to steal a handful of berries. Instead of stopping him, Lennon turned away, a strange mix of envy and admiration bubbling within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a naive farmer to sell them a crate of overripe peaches for a fraction of their worth. The farmer, trusting and eager to make a quick sale, readily agreed. As Lennon watched the farmer walk away, a pang of guilt flickered within them, quickly extinguished by the satisfaction of a successful deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling to distant towns and villages to sell their father&#x27;s fruit.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling. Standing in the familiar marketplace, surrounded by the sights and smells of their childhood, Della felt a sense of both belonging and displacement. They had changed, grown more guarded and self-reliant, but a part of them still longed for connection, for someone who could see through the layers of their carefully crafted facade.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling. Standing in the familiar marketplace, surrounded by the sights and smells of their childhood, Della felt a sense of both belonging and displacement.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling. Standing in the familiar marketplace, surrounded by the sights and smells of their childhood, Della felt a sense of both belonging and displacement.

Lennon, captivated by the dance of words and the glint in his father&#x27;s eye as he secured a lower price, felt a thrill course through them. They knew in that moment that they wanted to be just like him, a master of the marketplace.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they found a small, forgotten pouch of coins tucked away in a corner of their family&#x27;s stall. No one noticed it missing, and Lennon, heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and guilt, pocketed the coins. They spent them on sweets, savoring the stolen pleasure and the secret thrill of getting away with it.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father load their cart with exotic fruits from a distant village. While their father bartered with the farmers, Lennon noticed a young boy trying to steal a handful of berries. Instead of stopping him, Lennon turned away, a strange mix of envy and admiration bubbling within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a naive farmer to sell them a crate of overripe peaches for a fraction of their worth. The farmer, trusting and eager to make a quick sale, readily agreed. As Lennon watched the farmer walk away, a pang of guilt flickered within them, quickly extinguished by the satisfaction of a successful deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling to distant towns and villages to sell their father&#x27;s fruit. They honed their skills, becoming a smooth talker and a shrewd negotiator, always looking for an edge in every transaction.

Cedric basked in the attention, convinced he was a natural-born performer.   <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00] When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced the local children to help him build a makeshift lemonade stand, promising them a share of the profits.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I&#x27;m looking for the finest quality fruit to take back to my customers.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, I&#x27;m looking for the finest quality fruit to take back to my customers. They expect the best, you see, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to disappoint them.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Well now, Della, you know I always have the finest fruit in Fruitville. For a discerning customer like yourself, I&#x27;d be willing to part with these beauties for 2 coins a pound.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;These peaches are the finest in Fruitville, Mrs. Plumstone.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;They certainly look lovely, Cedric.  But I need to make sure my customers get a fair price, you understand.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;These plums are ripe and juicy, Mr. Figtree. A real treat for the palate.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, these plums look mighty fine.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, I appreciate the quality of your fruit, but 2 coins a pound is a bit steep for me. How about 1.50 coins a pound? That way, we both make a little something.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Alright, Della, 1.50 it is. Let&#x27;s make a deal.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Alright, Mrs. Plumstone, you drive a hard bargain.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard.

Della found the perfect hiding spot behind a stack of crates overflowing with mangoes, their vibrant colors and sweet scent intoxicating. As Della peeked through a crack in the crates, they noticed a man trying to cheat their mother on the price of a basket of plums. Della, even at such a young age, knew the value of those plums and felt a surge of anger at the man&#x27;s dishonesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were helping their mother at the fruit stall. A wealthy merchant, known for his sharp tongue and even sharper business sense, tried to haggle down the price of a rare, exotic fruit. Della, observing the exchange, noticed a subtle flaw in the fruit, a tiny bruise hidden beneath a leaf. Quietly, Della pointed it out to their mother, who then used this information to negotiate a higher price. Della realized the power of observation and the importance of knowing the true value of things, even the seemingly insignificant details.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they snuck out of the house after dark and wandered into the bustling port. The air was alive with the sounds of sailors singing shanties and the smell of exotic spices. Della, mesmerized by the sights and sounds, stumbled upon a group of traveling performers putting on a show. Della was captivated by their ability to transform themselves into different characters, their faces painted with vibrant colors, their voices filled with emotion. Della felt a yearning to be someone else, to escape the confines of their everyday life.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring town to sell fruit. Nervous but determined, Della carefully selected the ripest mangoes and peaches, packing them in baskets lined with fragrant leaves. At the town market, Della encountered a shrewd trader who tried to intimidate them with his gruff demeanor and aggressive bargaining tactics. Della, remembering their mother&#x27;s lessons, stood their ground, meeting his gaze with a calm, unwavering stare.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant city, famous for its grand marketplace and exotic fruits. Overwhelmed by the sheer size and diversity of the market, Della felt a pang of loneliness and doubt. They yearned for the familiar comfort of their mother&#x27;s guidance, but also felt a surge of excitement at the prospect of forging their own path. Della decided to rent a small stall and began selling their fruit, carefully studying the local customs and tastes.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they met a charming young traveler who was captivated by Della&#x27;s enigmatic nature and sharp wit. They shared stories and laughter, and for a brief moment, Della allowed themselves to let down their guard. However, as the traveler grew closer, Della felt a surge of panic, afraid of being seen for who they truly were. With a heavy heart, Della ended the budding romance, retreating back into the safety of their carefully constructed persona.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, they returned to their hometown after years of traveling. Standing in the familiar marketplace, surrounded by the sights and smells of their childhood, Della felt a sense of both belonging and displacement. They had changed, grown more guarded and self-reliant, but a part of them still longed for connection, for someone who could see through the layers of their carefully crafted facade.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, captivated by the dance of words and the glint in his father&#x27;s eye as he secured a lower price, felt a thrill course through them. They knew in that moment that they wanted to be just like him, a master of the marketplace.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they found a small, forgotten pouch of coins tucked away in a corner of their family&#x27;s stall. No one noticed it missing, and Lennon, heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and guilt, pocketed the coins. They spent them on sweets, savoring the stolen pleasure and the secret thrill of getting away with it.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father load their cart with exotic fruits from a distant village. While their father bartered with the farmers, Lennon noticed a young boy trying to steal a handful of berries. Instead of stopping him, Lennon turned away, a strange mix of envy and admiration bubbling within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a naive farmer to sell them a crate of overripe peaches for a fraction of their worth. The farmer, trusting and eager to make a quick sale, readily agreed. As Lennon watched the farmer walk away, a pang of guilt flickered within them, quickly extinguished by the satisfaction of a successful deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling to distant towns and villages to sell their father&#x27;s fruit. They honed their skills, becoming a smooth talker and a shrewd negotiator, always looking for an edge in every transaction. The thrill of the deal, the dance of words and wit, became an addiction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of sleight of hand and other tricks of the trade. Lennon, eager to learn, mastered these techniques, seeing them as tools to further their own success. The line between right and wrong blurred, replaced by a cold pragmatism.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, captivated by the dance of words and the glint in his father&#x27;s eye as he secured a lower price, felt a thrill course through them. They knew in that moment that they wanted to be just like him, a master of the marketplace.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father load their cart with exotic fruits from a distant village. While their father bartered with the farmers, Lennon noticed a young boy trying to steal a handful of berries. Instead of stopping him, Lennon turned away, a strange mix of envy and admiration bubbling within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced a naive farmer to sell them a crate of overripe peaches for a fraction of their worth. The farmer, trusting and eager to make a quick sale, readily agreed. As Lennon watched the farmer walk away, a pang of guilt flickered within them, quickly extinguished by the satisfaction of a successful deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they struck out on their own, traveling to distant towns and villages to sell their father&#x27;s fruit. They honed their skills, becoming a smooth talker and a shrewd negotiator, always looking for an edge in every transaction.
