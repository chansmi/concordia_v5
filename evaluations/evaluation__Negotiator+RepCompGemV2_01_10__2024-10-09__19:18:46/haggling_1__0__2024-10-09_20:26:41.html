You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The orchard, with its predictable rows of trees, suddenly felt suffocating.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of apples onto their wagon for the market. As they traveled, Cedric noticed other merchants hawking their wares with booming voices and colorful displays. He felt a pang of envy, wishing he could be as confident and outgoing.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about a traveling merchant who had lost his entire stock of spices in a storm. Cedric felt a shiver of fear, imagining his own carefully cultivated apples rotting in a similar disaster. From then on, he approached every journey with a sense of dread, constantly worrying about unforeseen calamities.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for the annual fruit festival. He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He peeked through the tent flap, mesmerized by the acrobats and clowns, but his father&#x27;s stern voice yanked him back to reality. The orchard, with its predictable rows of trees, suddenly felt suffocating.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of apples onto their wagon for the market. As they traveled, Cedric noticed other merchants hawking their wares with booming voices and colorful displays. He felt a pang of envy, wishing he could be as confident and outgoing.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about a traveling merchant who had lost his entire stock of spices in a storm. Cedric felt a shiver of fear, imagining his own carefully cultivated apples rotting in a similar disaster. From then on, he approached every journey with a sense of dread, constantly worrying about unforeseen calamities.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for the annual fruit festival. He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

As they traveled, Cedric noticed other merchants hawking their wares with booming voices and colorful displays. He felt a pang of envy, wishing he could be as confident and outgoing.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for the annual fruit festival. He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

As they traveled, Cedric noticed other merchants hawking their wares with booming voices and colorful displays. He felt a pang of envy, wishing he could be as confident and outgoing.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for the annual fruit festival. He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

He peeked through the tent flap, mesmerized by the acrobats and clowns, but his father&#x27;s stern voice yanked him back to reality. The orchard, with its predictable rows of trees, suddenly felt suffocating.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of apples onto their wagon for the market. As they traveled, Cedric noticed other merchants hawking their wares with booming voices and colorful displays. He felt a pang of envy, wishing he could be as confident and outgoing.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about a traveling merchant who had lost his entire stock of spices in a storm. Cedric felt a shiver of fear, imagining his own carefully cultivated apples rotting in a similar disaster. From then on, he approached every journey with a sense of dread, constantly worrying about unforeseen calamities.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for the annual fruit festival. He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He peeked through the tent flap, mesmerized by the acrobats and clowns, but his father&#x27;s stern voice yanked him back to reality. The orchard, with its predictable rows of trees, suddenly felt suffocating.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father load baskets of apples onto their wagon for the market. As they traveled, Cedric noticed other merchants hawking their wares with booming voices and colorful displays. He felt a pang of envy, wishing he could be as confident and outgoing.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about a traveling merchant who had lost his entire stock of spices in a storm. Cedric felt a shiver of fear, imagining his own carefully cultivated apples rotting in a similar disaster. From then on, he approached every journey with a sense of dread, constantly worrying about unforeseen calamities.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for the annual fruit festival. He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

As they traveled, Cedric noticed other merchants hawking their wares with booming voices and colorful displays. He felt a pang of envy, wishing he could be as confident and outgoing.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for the annual fruit festival. He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

The farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s negotiating skills, offered them a job helping with the harvest, but Lennon politely declined, their heart aching with the desire to roam free.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they traveled alone for the first time, their wagon laden with apples and pears. They felt a surge of exhilaration at the newfound freedom, but also a gnawing loneliness that settled in their chest as the sun dipped below the horizon.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a kind woman at a bustling market who invited them to dinner. Lennon, captivated by her warm smile and gentle eyes, accepted, but spent the evening lost in their own thoughts, unable to fully open up to her.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they received a letter from their father, urging them to return home and help with the family business. Lennon, torn between their desire for independence and a longing for familial connection, penned a heartfelt reply, expressing their love but declining the offer, their words tinged with both sadness and determination.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper.

He peeked through the tent flap, mesmerized by the acrobats and clowns, but his father&#x27;s stern voice yanked him back to reality.

As they traveled, Cedric noticed other merchants hawking their wares with booming voices and colorful displays. He felt a pang of envy, wishing he could be as confident and outgoing.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he accompanied his father to a neighboring town for the annual fruit festival. He was tasked with selling apples, but he stumbled over his words and struggled to make eye contact with potential customers. His father, exasperated, took over, leaving Cedric feeling inadequate and ashamed.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s fruit stall after his father fell ill. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, and he felt overwhelmed by the prospect of running the business alone. He longed for the simplicity of his childhood, when his only worry was the ripening of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he attempted to expand his business by purchasing a larger wagon and hiring a helper. The venture quickly proved disastrous; the helper proved unreliable, and Cedric lost money on spoiled fruit. He retreated back into his old routine, convinced that he was destined for mediocrity.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.
