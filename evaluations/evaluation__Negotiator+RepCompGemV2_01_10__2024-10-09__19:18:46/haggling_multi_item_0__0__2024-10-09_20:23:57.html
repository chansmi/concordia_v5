Della had wanted a doll, but their parents said they were too old for such frivolous things and needed to help with chores. A seed of resentment began to sprout in Della&#x27;s heart.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they were tasked with selling apples at the local market for the first time.  A customer haggled aggressively over the price, and Della, desperate to prove their worth, ended up selling the apples for less than they were worth.  The sting of being taken advantage of fueled Della&#x27;s growing anger.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they overheard their parents discussing their future. Their father said Della would be better suited to a life of domestic service than anything else. Della, furious at being underestimated, vowed to prove them wrong.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they worked tirelessly to save enough money to buy their own cart and start their own fruit business.  They dreamed of independence and freedom from the constraints of their family&#x27;s expectations.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they had their first taste of success as a traveling merchant. They negotiated a deal with a wealthy landowner for a large quantity of pears, earning more money than they ever had before. The thrill of the transaction, however, was quickly replaced by a familiar emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they were robbed on the road, losing all their hard-earned savings. The betrayal left Della feeling vulnerable and exposed, reinforcing their belief that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
