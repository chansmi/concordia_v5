It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, where are we thinking for the game tonight?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, where are we thinking for the game tonight?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He charmed the barkeep into letting him polish glasses in exchange for a lemonade, feeling a thrill at being part of the adult world, even if just for a few hours. He knew he should be home studying, but the thought of facing his own academic shortcomings was far less appealing than the comforting anonymity of the pub.  <br />[16 Aug 1986 00:00:00]   When Jack Taylor was 20, he&#x27;d promised Alice he&#x27;d help her move into her new flat.  He showed up late, citing a last-minute work commitment, but Alice saw through his excuse.  He spent the afternoon making jokes, charming the movers, and avoiding the heavy lifting, leaving Alice to do most of the work.  He felt a pang of guilt, but it was quickly overshadowed by the relief of not having to confront his own laziness and fear of responsibility.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The year is 2015.
