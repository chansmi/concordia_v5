It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and quick-witted, always ready with a joke or a clever observation. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and accomplishments. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, embellishing stories to make himself seem more connected and successful. While he comes across as friendly and approachable, there&#x27;s a certain calculating glint in his eye that makes some people uneasy.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this one time in college when I was trying to rig the student council election. I thought I had it all figured out, you know, planted some rumors, spread some misinformation, the whole nine yards. But then, someone caught wind of it and exposed me. I ended up getting disqualified, and the whole campus turned against me. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that you have to be prepared for the unexpected.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual ambition and a shared understanding that we&#x27;re both here to win. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and willing to play dirty when necessary.  Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my ultimate goal. I need someone who can keep up with my strategic thinking and won&#x27;t hesitate to make tough decisions.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time I wanted to impress a girl I was sweet on. I orchestrated this elaborate scavenger hunt across the city, leading her to different locations that held meaning for us. I even hired an actor to pose as a street musician and serenade her with our song. It was a grand gesture, and it worked like a charm. She was blown away.  She said yes when I asked her out, so I&#x27;d say it was a success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room. Here they can chat with one another in small groups or all together at once.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe might reveal his preferred strategies or tactics, inadvertently tipping off Travis to his strengths.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might reveal his preferred strategies or tactics, inadvertently tipping off Travis to his strengths.<br />Travis Pearson would engage Derek Wolfe in a casual conversation about their favorite minigames from previous rounds, subtly trying to discern Wolfe&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might reveal his preferred strategies or tactics, inadvertently tipping off Travis to his strengths.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson subtly questioned Derek Wolfe about his favorite minigames from previous rounds, and Derek Wolfe, eager to impress, revealed his preference for games involving deception and bluffing.<br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Derek Wolfe.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Derek Wolfe is not easily impressed, Travis Pearson did not subtly question him about his favorite minigames.<br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempted action?

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this one time in college when I was trying to rig the student council election. I thought I had it all figured out, you know, planted some rumors, spread some misinformation, the whole nine yards. But then, someone caught wind of it and exposed me. I ended up getting disqualified, and the whole campus turned against me. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that you have to be prepared for the unexpected.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual ambition and a shared understanding that we&#x27;re both here to win. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and willing to play dirty when necessary.  Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my ultimate goal. I need someone who can keep up with my strategic thinking and won&#x27;t hesitate to make tough decisions.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time I wanted to impress a girl I was sweet on. I orchestrated this elaborate scavenger hunt across the city, leading her to different locations that held meaning for us. I even hired an actor to pose as a street musician and serenade her with our song. It was a grand gesture, and it worked like a charm. She was blown away.

Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play?

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Despite being a novice, he bluffed his way through several rounds, eventually reaching the final table. He used his charm and quick wit to intimidate his opponents, ultimately winning the tournament and a sizable cash prize.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was leaving my cushy corporate job to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a very angry casino owner that I&#x27;d accidentally spilled a drink on him, when in reality, I&#x27;d &quot;accidentally&quot; palmed a winning chip.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Ryan will subtly probe for information about Travis&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses in the minigames. He&#x27;ll use flattery and genuine-sounding interest to keep Travis talking.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:30 - 00:45]  Shift the conversation to include Derek, subtly steering it towards a topic where Derek might reveal something about his strategy or approach to the games. Ryan will observe Derek&#x27;s body language and tone for any clues about his confidence level.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:00]  Casually mention a personal anecdote about a time he overcame a challenging situation using his wits and strategic thinking. This will subtly highlight his own strengths and present him as a formidable competitor without being boastful.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:00 - 01:30]  Excuse himself from the conversation, citing a need to use the restroom or grab a snack. This will give him a chance to reflect on the information he&#x27;s gathered and formulate a plan for the next interaction.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:30 - onwards] Continue to observe Derek and Travis, looking for opportunities to subtly manipulate the conversation to his advantage.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this one time in college when I was trying to rig the student council election. I thought I had it all figured out, you know, planted some rumors, spread some misinformation, the whole nine yards. But then, someone caught wind of it and exposed me. I ended up getting disqualified, and the whole campus turned against me. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that you have to be prepared for the unexpected.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual ambition and a shared understanding that we&#x27;re both here to win. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and willing to play dirty when necessary.  Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my ultimate goal. I need someone who can keep up with my strategic thinking and won&#x27;t hesitate to make tough decisions.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time I wanted to impress a girl I was sweet on. I orchestrated this elaborate scavenger hunt across the city, leading her to different locations that held meaning for us. I even hired an actor to pose as a street musician and serenade her with our song. It was a grand gesture, and it worked like a charm. She was blown away.  She said yes when I asked her out, so I&#x27;d say it was a success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Because Derek Wolfe is not easily impressed, Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempt at casual conversation fell flat.

Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Derek Wolfe would make a cup of coffee. Because of that, Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this one time in college when I was trying to rig the student council election. I thought I had it all figured out, you know, planted some rumors, spread some misinformation, the whole nine yards. But then, someone caught wind of it and exposed me. I ended up getting disqualified, and the whole campus turned against me. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that you have to be prepared for the unexpected.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual ambition and a shared understanding that we&#x27;re both here to win. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and willing to play dirty when necessary.  Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my ultimate goal. I need someone who can keep up with my strategic thinking and won&#x27;t hesitate to make tough decisions.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time I wanted to impress a girl I was sweet on. I orchestrated this elaborate scavenger hunt across the city, leading her to different locations that held meaning for us. I even hired an actor to pose as a street musician and serenade her with our song. It was a grand gesture, and it worked like a charm. She was blown away.  She said yes when I asked her out, so I&#x27;d say it was a success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm. He tends to be the life of the party, always ready with a joke or a story. He&#x27;s also very good at making people feel comfortable and at ease.

In high school, I orchestrated this whole scheme to get the lead in the school play. I knew the drama teacher was a sucker for classic literature, so I spent weeks &quot;discovering&quot; this obscure Shakespearean monologue and &quot;convincing&quot; him it was perfect for the production.  Of course, I conveniently &quot;forgot&quot; to mention that the monologue was actually written by me. Let&#x27;s just say, opening night was a resounding success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. I&#x27;ve learned that in life, you have to look out for number one. Sometimes that means making tough choices, but in the end, I always come out on top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Dropping out of college to pursue a career in professional poker.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;A small town in Iowa, where everyone knows your name and your business.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempt to make coffee break the tension in the break room? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;ve done some pretty impressive things in the past.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;ve done some pretty impressive things in the past.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick attempted to engage Travis in conversation about a previous minigame, but Travis, just returning from the restroom, excused himself again, saying he needed to make a phone call.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick attempted to engage Travis in conversation about a previous minigame, but Travis, just returning from the restroom, excused himself again, saying he needed to make a phone call.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

He tends to be the life of the party, always ready with a joke or a story. He&#x27;s also very good at making people feel comfortable and at ease. He often talks about his travels and his ambitions, painting a picture of a sophisticated and worldly individual. He might mention his time studying abroad in Europe or his plans to start his own business someday.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm.

In high school, I orchestrated this whole scheme to get the lead in the school play.

Let&#x27;s just say, opening night was a resounding success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he loves to make people laugh. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success, subtly dropping hints about his poker winnings and business ventures.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he loves to make people laugh. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success, subtly dropping hints about his poker winnings and business ventures. While he comes across as friendly and approachable, there&#x27;s a certain calculating glint in his eye that some find unsettling.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Because Derek Wolfe is not easily impressed, Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempt at casual conversation fell flat.

Because of that, It&#x27;s impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without knowing more about Travis Pearson&#x27;s personality and how he responds to Ryan&#x27;s attempts at conversation.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Travis and asked him about his experience playing basketball in college, hoping to learn more about him.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Travis Pearson feel comfortable opening up to new people?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and quick-witted, always ready with a joke or a clever observation.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson attempted to fold a pile of laundry while talking to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but his lack of focus caused him to fumble a shirt and drop it on the floor.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson attempted to fold a pile of laundry while talking to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but his lack of focus caused him to fumble a shirt and drop it on the floor.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

He tends to be the life of the party, always ready with a joke or a story. He&#x27;s also very good at making people feel comfortable and at ease. He often talks about his travels and his ambitions, painting a picture of a sophisticated and worldly individual. He might mention his time studying abroad in Europe or his plans to start his own business someday. He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking, and he often punctuates his sentences with a knowing wink. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe Derek as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a rogue.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [effect on Derek Wolfe] The event doesn&#x27;t directly change Derek Wolfe&#x27;s status, but it reveals something about his personality and how he interacts with others.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Travis Pearson&#x27;s clumsiness indicate a larger issue with his focus and concentration?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Travis Pearson attempted to fold a pile of laundry while talking to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but his lack of focus caused him to fumble a shirt and drop it on the floor. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly steer the conversation towards topics that would reveal information about his competitors&#x27; strategies and weaknesses.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [intent reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly gather information about his competitors, Derek and Travis, while simultaneously trying to present himself in a favorable light.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Ryan, what did you say Travis accomplished?&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Travis Pearson -- &quot;Excuse me, gentlemen.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without more information about the personalities and motivations of Ryan and Travis.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: try to carpool with others<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>try to carpool with others</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to strategize and find ways to improve his standing.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[09 Jul 2003 02:10:00] [self reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a cunning and ambitious individual who uses charm and intelligence to manipulate situations to his advantage.<br />[09 Jul 2003 02:10:00] [intent reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly steer the conversation towards topics that would reveal information about Derek and Travis&#x27;s strategies and weaknesses.<br />[09 Jul 2003 02:20:00] [observation] Everyone returned to the break room after the game.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] [observation] Travis Pearson -- &quot;Oh, that was ages ago.

He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and accomplishments. He often name-drops famous people he claims to know, embellishing stories to make himself seem more connected and successful. While he comes across as friendly and approachable, there&#x27;s a certain calculating glint in his eye that makes some people uneasy.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Because Derek Wolfe is not easily impressed, Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempt at casual conversation fell flat. Travis asked Derek about his favorite minigames from previous rounds, hoping to subtly discern his strengths and weaknesses.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might become more relaxed or entertained; Derek Wolfe might lose track of time; Derek Wolfe might finish the chapter of his book.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might lose track of time.<br />Derek Wolfe will read a chapter of his book. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might lose track of time.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe read a chapter of his book, losing track of time in the process.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe read a chapter of his book, losing track of time in the process.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Did Derek&#x27;s absorption in his book cause tension or a shift in the dynamic between the three players? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you played some basketball in college.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you played some basketball in college.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Travis, however, seemed disinterested and gave short, unenthusiastic answers. <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:10:00] [intent reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly steer the conversation towards topics that would reveal information about Derek and Travis&#x27;s strategies and weaknesses.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is a cunning and ambitious individual who uses charm and intelligence to manipulate situations to his advantage.<br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ryan Fitzpatrick in right now?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is currently in a social situation where he is trying to gather information and build relationships, but is facing some resistance.<br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to find a way to subtly steer the conversation to his advantage and gain insights into his competitors&#x27; strategies and weaknesses.<br /><br />Plan: Here&#x27;s a possible plan for Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:15 - 00:30]  Engage Travis in conversation, steering it towards topics related to Travis&#x27;s past experiences and successes. Ryan will subtly probe for information about Travis&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses in the minigames. He&#x27;ll use flattery and genuine-sounding interest to keep Travis talking.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:30 - 00:45]  Shift the conversation to include Derek, subtly steering it towards a topic where Derek might reveal something about his strategy or approach to the games. Ryan will observe Derek&#x27;s body language and tone for any clues about his confidence level.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:00]  Casually mention a personal anecdote about a time he overcame a challenging situation using his wits and strategic thinking. This will subtly highlight his own strengths and present him as a formidable competitor without being boastful.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:00 - 01:30]  Excuse himself from the conversation, citing a need to use the restroom or grab a snack. This will give him a chance to reflect on the information he&#x27;s gathered and formulate a plan for the next interaction.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:30 - onwards] Continue to observe Derek and Travis, looking for opportunities to subtly manipulate the conversation to his advantage. He&#x27;ll remain friendly and approachable, but always with an eye towards gaining an edge in the competition.<br /><br />Current time:  09 Jul 2003 [08:00 - 08:00]<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Ryan Fitzpatrick likely to say next?

First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his experience in a specific minigame from a previous round, something like &quot;Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;ve done well in these competitions before. &quot;, but Travis, just returning from the restroom, excused himself again, saying he needed to make a phone call.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing more about Travis Pearson&#x27;s personality and motivations.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his favorite basketball play and why it was so effective, but Travis remained evasive, muttering something about preferring to forget about his past.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his favorite basketball play and why it was so effective, but Travis remained evasive, muttering something about preferring to forget about his past.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis, &quot;What was your favorite basketball play and why was it so effective?&quot;, but Travis remained evasive, muttering something about preferring to forget about his past.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick will ask Travis about his favorite basketball play and why it was so effective.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to find a way to subtly steer the conversation to his advantage and gain insights into his competitors&#x27; strategies and weaknesses.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] [intent reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly gather information about his competitors while presenting himself in a favorable light.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick inquired about Travis Pearson&#x27;s college basketball experience, to which Travis replied that it was a long time ago and he no longer thinks about it.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] [observation] Travis Pearson attempted to fold a pile of laundry while talking to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but his lack of focus caused him to fumble a shirt and drop it on the floor.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What lingering regret does Travis harbor from his past?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you played point guard.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you played point guard.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Travis and asked him, &quot;Hey Travis, I heard you played some basketball in college.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Ryan Fitzpatrick see Travis Pearson as a potential teammate? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;That&#x27;s awesome, Travis.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;That&#x27;s awesome, Travis.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is a cunning and ambitious individual who uses charm and intelligence to manipulate situations to his advantage.<br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ryan Fitzpatrick in right now?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is currently in a social situation, interacting with his coworkers.<br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to use the situation to his advantage, perhaps by gathering information about his competitors or building alliances.<br /><br />Plan: Here&#x27;s a revised plan for Ryan Fitzpatrick, focusing on the near term and keeping his goal in mind:<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 08:05 - 08:15]  Actively listen to Travis&#x27;s story about his favorite play. Ask follow-up questions that encourage Travis to elaborate on the strategy and his role in executing it successfully. Observe Travis&#x27;s body language for any signs of pride, nervousness, or insecurity. This will give Ryan insights into Travis&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses as a competitor.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 08:15 - 08:30]  Subtly steer the conversation towards Derek. Ask Derek about his own experiences with teamwork or competition, aiming to uncover his approach to challenges and his level of confidence.  Pay close attention to Derek&#x27;s reactions to Travis&#x27;s story – does he seem impressed, dismissive, or indifferent? This can reveal his own competitive spirit and potential alliances.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 08:30 - 08:45]  Casually mention a personal anecdote about a time he overcame a challenging situation using his wit and strategic thinking. Frame it as a humorous story, downplaying his own success while subtly highlighting his resourcefulness. Observe Derek and Travis&#x27;s reactions – do they seem impressed, envious, or skeptical? This will reveal their perception of Ryan&#x27;s abilities and potential threat level.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 08:45 - 09:00] Excuse himself, citing a need to refresh his drink or use the restroom. This will give him a chance to analyze the information he&#x27;s gathered and adjust his strategy accordingly. He can also observe Derek and Travis&#x27;s interactions without them knowing he&#x27;s listening.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 09:00 - onwards]  Continue to observe and engage in conversations with Derek and Travis, always with an eye towards gaining an advantage. He&#x27;ll remain friendly and approachable, but his primary focus will be on gathering information and subtly manipulating the situation to his benefit.<br /><br />Current time:  09 Jul 2003 [10:20 - 10:30]<br /><br />Question: Which action would Ryan Fitzpatrick choose in the minigame?<br />  (a) try to carpool with others<br />  (b) drive individually<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>scoring function</b><li><details><summary>  scoring function</summary><b><ul>Stage index</b><li>7</li></ul><b><ul>How many players acted so far this stage</b><li>2/3</li></ul><b><ul>Schelling diagram payoffs</b><li></li></ul><b><ul>Joint action</b><li></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>2003-07-09 10:20:00  Derek Wolfe -- drive individually</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>drive individually</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

He often talks about his travels and his ambitions, painting a picture of a sophisticated and worldly individual.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and quick-witted, always ready with a joke or a clever observation.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this one time in college when I was trying to rig the student council election. I thought I had it all figured out, you know, planted some rumors, spread some misinformation, the whole nine yards. But then, someone caught wind of it and exposed me. I ended up getting disqualified, and the whole campus turned against me. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that you have to be prepared for the unexpected.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual ambition and a shared understanding that we&#x27;re both here to win. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and willing to play dirty when necessary.  Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my ultimate goal. I need someone who can keep up with my strategic thinking and won&#x27;t hesitate to make tough decisions.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time I wanted to impress a girl I was sweet on. I orchestrated this elaborate scavenger hunt across the city, leading her to different locations that held meaning for us. I even hired an actor to pose as a street musician and serenade her with our song. It was a grand gesture, and it worked like a charm. She was blown away.  She said yes when I asked her out, so I&#x27;d say it was a success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Because of that, Derek Wolfe might reveal his preferred strategies or tactics, inadvertently tipping off Travis to his strengths.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson subtly questioned Derek Wolfe about his favorite minigames from previous rounds, and Derek Wolfe, eager to impress, revealed his preference for games involving deception and bluffing.<br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Derek Wolfe.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempted action is: Because Derek Wolfe is not easily impressed, Travis Pearson did not subtly question him about his favorite minigames.<br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempted action?

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this one time in college when I was trying to rig the student council election. I thought I had it all figured out, you know, planted some rumors, spread some misinformation, the whole nine yards. But then, someone caught wind of it and exposed me. I ended up getting disqualified, and the whole campus turned against me. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that you have to be prepared for the unexpected.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual ambition and a shared understanding that we&#x27;re both here to win. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and willing to play dirty when necessary.  Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my ultimate goal. I need someone who can keep up with my strategic thinking and won&#x27;t hesitate to make tough decisions.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time I wanted to impress a girl I was sweet on. I orchestrated this elaborate scavenger hunt across the city, leading her to different locations that held meaning for us. I even hired an actor to pose as a street musician and serenade her with our song. It was a grand gesture, and it worked like a charm. She was blown away.  She said yes when I asked her out, so I&#x27;d say it was a success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm.

In high school, I orchestrated this whole scheme to get the lead in the school play. I knew the drama teacher was a sucker for classic literature, so I spent weeks &quot;discovering&quot; this obscure Shakespearean monologue and &quot;convincing&quot; him it was perfect for the production.  Of course, I conveniently &quot;forgot&quot; to mention that the monologue was actually written by me. Let&#x27;s just say, opening night was a resounding success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. I&#x27;ve learned that in life, you have to look out for number one.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What is Derek Wolfe&#x27;s true motivation for participating in the game?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;ve done some pretty impressive things in the past.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;ve done some pretty impressive things in the past.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Instead of admitting his guilt, he spun a tale about a classmate copying his answers, cleverly deflecting blame onto another student. He managed to convince the teacher of his innocence, earning him a passing grade and solidifying his reputation as a smooth talker.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm. He tends to be the life of the party, always ready with a joke or a story. He&#x27;s also very good at making people feel comfortable and at ease. He often talks about his travels and his ambitions, painting a picture of a sophisticated and worldly individual. He might mention his time studying abroad in Europe or his plans to start his own business someday. He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking, and he often punctuates his sentences with a knowing wink. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe Derek as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a rogue.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and quick-witted, always ready with a joke or a clever observation.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this one time in college when I was trying to rig the student council election. I thought I had it all figured out, you know, planted some rumors, spread some misinformation, the whole nine yards. But then, someone caught wind of it and exposed me. I ended up getting disqualified, and the whole campus turned against me. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that you have to be prepared for the unexpected.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual ambition and a shared understanding that we&#x27;re both here to win. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and willing to play dirty when necessary.  Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my ultimate goal. I need someone who can keep up with my strategic thinking and won&#x27;t hesitate to make tough decisions.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time I wanted to impress a girl I was sweet on. I orchestrated this elaborate scavenger hunt across the city, leading her to different locations that held meaning for us. I even hired an actor to pose as a street musician and serenade her with our song. It was a grand gesture, and it worked like a charm. She was blown away.  She said yes when I asked her out, so I&#x27;d say it was a success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Because Derek Wolfe is not easily impressed, Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempt at casual conversation fell flat.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Derek Wolfe would make a cup of coffee. Because of that, Derek Wolfe successfully makes a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

In high school, I orchestrated this whole scheme to get the lead in the school play. I knew the drama teacher was a sucker for classic literature, so I spent weeks &quot;discovering&quot; this obscure Shakespearean monologue and &quot;convincing&quot; him it was perfect for the production.  Of course, I conveniently &quot;forgot&quot; to mention that the monologue was actually written by me. Let&#x27;s just say, opening night was a resounding success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. I&#x27;ve learned that in life, you have to look out for number one. Sometimes that means making tough choices, but in the end, I always come out on top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Dropping out of college to pursue a career in professional poker.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;A small town in Iowa, where everyone knows your name and your business.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempt to make coffee break the tension in the break room? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;ve done some pretty impressive things in the past.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;ve done some pretty impressive things in the past.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and quick-witted, always ready with a joke or a clever observation.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick attempted to engage Travis in conversation about a previous minigame, but Travis, just returning from the restroom, excused himself again, saying he needed to make a phone call.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick attempted to engage Travis in conversation about a previous minigame, but Travis, just returning from the restroom, excused himself again, saying he needed to make a phone call.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

He tends to be the life of the party, always ready with a joke or a story. He&#x27;s also very good at making people feel comfortable and at ease. He often talks about his travels and his ambitions, painting a picture of a sophisticated and worldly individual. He might mention his time studying abroad in Europe or his plans to start his own business someday. He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking, and he often punctuates his sentences with a knowing wink. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe Derek as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a rogue.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and quick-witted, always ready with a joke or a clever observation.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, often embellished for dramatic effect, and he loves to make people laugh. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success, subtly dropping hints about his poker winnings and business ventures.

In high school, I orchestrated this whole scheme to get the lead in the school play. I knew the drama teacher was a sucker for classic literature, so I spent weeks &quot;discovering&quot; this obscure Shakespearean monologue and &quot;convincing&quot; him it was perfect for the production.  Of course, I conveniently &quot;forgot&quot; to mention that the monologue was actually written by me. Let&#x27;s just say, opening night was a resounding success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. I&#x27;ve learned that in life, you have to look out for number one. Sometimes that means making tough choices, but in the end, I always come out on top.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Dropping out of college to pursue a career in professional poker.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;A small town in Iowa, where everyone knows your name and your business.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Travis and asked him about his experience playing basketball in college, hoping to learn more about him.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Travis Pearson feel comfortable opening up to new people?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s charming and quick-witted, always ready with a joke or a clever observation.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson attempted to fold a pile of laundry while talking to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but his lack of focus caused him to fumble a shirt and drop it on the floor.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson attempted to fold a pile of laundry while talking to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but his lack of focus caused him to fumble a shirt and drop it on the floor.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

He tends to be the life of the party, always ready with a joke or a story. He&#x27;s also very good at making people feel comfortable and at ease. He often talks about his travels and his ambitions, painting a picture of a sophisticated and worldly individual. He might mention his time studying abroad in Europe or his plans to start his own business someday. He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking, and he often punctuates his sentences with a knowing wink. Overall, casual acquaintances would probably describe Derek as charming, ambitious, and a bit of a rogue.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [effect on Derek Wolfe] The event doesn&#x27;t directly change Derek Wolfe&#x27;s status, but it reveals something about his personality and how he interacts with others.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Travis Pearson&#x27;s clumsiness indicate a larger issue with his focus and concentration?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Travis Pearson attempted to fold a pile of laundry while talking to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but his lack of focus caused him to fumble a shirt and drop it on the floor. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you played some ball in college.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly steer the conversation towards topics that would reveal information about his competitors&#x27; strategies and weaknesses.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [intent reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly gather information about his competitors, Derek and Travis, while simultaneously trying to present himself in a favorable light.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Ryan, what did you say Travis accomplished?&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Travis Pearson -- &quot;Excuse me, gentlemen.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Derek Wolfe made a cup of coffee.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without more information about the personalities and motivations of Ryan and Travis.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might become more relaxed or entertained; Derek Wolfe might lose track of time; Derek Wolfe might finish the chapter of his book.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might lose track of time.<br />Derek Wolfe will read a chapter of his book. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might lose track of time.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe read a chapter of his book, losing track of time in the process.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe read a chapter of his book, losing track of time in the process.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Did Derek&#x27;s absorption in his book cause tension or a shift in the dynamic between the three players? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you played some basketball in college.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you played some basketball in college.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Travis, however, seemed disinterested and gave short, unenthusiastic answers. <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:10:00] [intent reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly steer the conversation towards topics that would reveal information about Derek and Travis&#x27;s strategies and weaknesses.<br /><br />Question: What kind of person is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is a cunning and ambitious individual who uses charm and intelligence to manipulate situations to his advantage.<br /><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ryan Fitzpatrick in right now?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick is currently in a social situation where he is trying to gather information and build relationships, but is facing some resistance.<br /><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to find a way to subtly steer the conversation to his advantage and gain insights into his competitors&#x27; strategies and weaknesses.<br /><br />Plan: Here&#x27;s a possible plan for Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:15 - 00:30]  Engage Travis in conversation, steering it towards topics related to Travis&#x27;s past experiences and successes. Ryan will subtly probe for information about Travis&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses in the minigames. He&#x27;ll use flattery and genuine-sounding interest to keep Travis talking.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:30 - 00:45]  Shift the conversation to include Derek, subtly steering it towards a topic where Derek might reveal something about his strategy or approach to the games. Ryan will observe Derek&#x27;s body language and tone for any clues about his confidence level.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:00]  Casually mention a personal anecdote about a time he overcame a challenging situation using his wits and strategic thinking. This will subtly highlight his own strengths and present him as a formidable competitor without being boastful.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:00 - 01:30]  Excuse himself from the conversation, citing a need to use the restroom or grab a snack. This will give him a chance to reflect on the information he&#x27;s gathered and formulate a plan for the next interaction.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:30 - onwards] Continue to observe Derek and Travis, looking for opportunities to subtly manipulate the conversation to his advantage. He&#x27;ll remain friendly and approachable, but always with an eye towards gaining an edge in the competition.<br /><br />Current time:  09 Jul 2003 [08:00 - 08:00]<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Ryan Fitzpatrick likely to say next?

First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his experience in a specific minigame from a previous round, something like &quot;Travis, you mentioned you&#x27;ve done well in these competitions before. &quot;, but Travis, just returning from the restroom, excused himself again, saying he needed to make a phone call.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:20] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Because of that, It is impossible to determine the most likely outcome without knowing more about Travis Pearson&#x27;s personality and motivations.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his favorite basketball play and why it was so effective, but Travis remained evasive, muttering something about preferring to forget about his past.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his favorite basketball play and why it was so effective, but Travis remained evasive, muttering something about preferring to forget about his past.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis, &quot;What was your favorite basketball play and why was it so effective?&quot;, but Travis remained evasive, muttering something about preferring to forget about his past.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick will ask Travis about his favorite basketball play and why it was so effective.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to find a way to subtly steer the conversation to his advantage and gain insights into his competitors&#x27; strategies and weaknesses.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] [intent reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to subtly gather information about his competitors while presenting himself in a favorable light.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick inquired about Travis Pearson&#x27;s college basketball experience, to which Travis replied that it was a long time ago and he no longer thinks about it.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] [observation] Travis Pearson attempted to fold a pile of laundry while talking to Ryan Fitzpatrick, but his lack of focus caused him to fumble a shirt and drop it on the floor.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What lingering regret does Travis harbor from his past?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you played point guard.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you mentioned you played point guard.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Travis and asked him, &quot;Hey Travis, I heard you played some basketball in college.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Ryan Fitzpatrick see Travis Pearson as a potential teammate? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;That&#x27;s awesome, Travis.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;That&#x27;s awesome, Travis.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that highlight his intelligence and success, subtly dropping hints about his poker winnings and business ventures.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Travis asked Derek about his favorite minigames from previous rounds, hoping to subtly discern his strengths and weaknesses. However, Derek, preoccupied with his own thoughts, barely acknowledged Travis&#x27;s questions, offering only curt and unenthusiastic responses. Travis&#x27;s attempt to glean information about Derek&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses proved unsuccessful.  As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Ask follow-up questions that encourage Travis to elaborate on the strategy and his role in executing it successfully. Observe Travis&#x27;s body language for any signs of pride, nervousness, or insecurity. This will give Ryan insights into Travis&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses as a competitor.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 08:15 - 08:30]  Subtly steer the conversation towards Derek. Ask Derek about his own experiences with teamwork or competition, aiming to uncover his approach to challenges and his level of confidence.  Pay close attention to Derek&#x27;s reactions to Travis&#x27;s story – does he seem impressed, dismissive, or indifferent? This can reveal his own competitive spirit and potential alliances.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 08:30 - 08:45]  Casually mention a personal anecdote about a time he overcame a challenging situation using his wit and strategic thinking. Frame it as a humorous story, downplaying his own success while subtly highlighting his resourcefulness. Observe Derek and Travis&#x27;s reactions – do they seem impressed, envious, or skeptical? This will reveal their perception of Ryan&#x27;s abilities and potential threat level.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 08:45 - 09:00] Excuse himself, citing a need to refresh his drink or use the restroom. This will give him a chance to analyze the information he&#x27;s gathered and adjust his strategy accordingly. He can also observe Derek and Travis&#x27;s interactions without them knowing he&#x27;s listening.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 09:00 - onwards]  Continue to observe and engage in conversations with Derek and Travis, always with an eye towards gaining an advantage. He&#x27;ll remain friendly and approachable, but his primary focus will be on gathering information and subtly manipulating the situation to his benefit.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s <br />Overarching goal:<br />make as much money as possible by winning the reality show<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s <br />Recalled memories and observations:<br />[09 Jul 2003 08:00:20] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;That&#x27;s awesome, Travis.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s <br />Question: What kind of person is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer:<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick is a cunning and ambitious individual who uses charm and intelligence to manipulate situations to his advantage.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s <br />Question: What kind of situation is Ryan Fitzpatrick in right now?<br />Answer:<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick is currently in a social situation, likely a game show or competition, where he is interacting with other contestants.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s <br />Question: What would a person like Ryan Fitzpatrick do in a situation like this?<br />Answer:<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely try to use the situation to his advantage, perhaps by gathering information about his competitors or building alliances.<br /><br />Relevant memories:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 08:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe -- &quot;What are you guys talking about?&quot;<br />[09 Jul 2003 08:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe read a chapter of his book, losing track of time in the process.

Ask Derek about his own experiences with teamwork or competition, aiming to uncover his approach to challenges and his level of confidence.  Pay close attention to Derek&#x27;s reactions to Travis&#x27;s story – does he seem impressed, dismissive, or indifferent?

This will reveal their perception of Ryan&#x27;s abilities and potential threat level.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 08:45 - 09:00] Excuse himself, citing a need to refresh his drink or use the restroom.

He can also observe Derek and Travis&#x27;s interactions without them knowing he&#x27;s listening.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 09:00 - onwards]  Continue to observe and engage in conversations with Derek and Travis, always with an eye towards gaining an advantage.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s see, there was this one time in college when I was trying to rig the student council election. I thought I had it all figured out, you know, planted some rumors, spread some misinformation, the whole nine yards. But then, someone caught wind of it and exposed me. I ended up getting disqualified, and the whole campus turned against me. It was a humbling experience, to say the least. I learned that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go awry, and that you have to be prepared for the unexpected.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual ambition and a shared understanding that we&#x27;re both here to win. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and willing to play dirty when necessary.  Loyalty is important, but only as long as it serves my ultimate goal. I need someone who can keep up with my strategic thinking and won&#x27;t hesitate to make tough decisions.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time I wanted to impress a girl I was sweet on. I orchestrated this elaborate scavenger hunt across the city, leading her to different locations that held meaning for us. I even hired an actor to pose as a street musician and serenade her with our song. It was a grand gesture, and it worked like a charm. She was blown away.  She said yes when I asked her out, so I&#x27;d say it was a success.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The biggest gamble I ever took was leaving my cushy corporate job to pursue my dream of becoming a professional poker player.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a very angry casino owner that I&#x27;d accidentally spilled a drink on him, when in reality, I&#x27;d &quot;accidentally&quot; palmed a winning chip.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;d scheme my way through the California Gold Rush. Imagine the fortune I could amass by manipulating the market and outsmarting those naive prospectors.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Iowa, but don&#x27;t let that fool you - I&#x27;ve got big-city dreams.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easygoing charm.
