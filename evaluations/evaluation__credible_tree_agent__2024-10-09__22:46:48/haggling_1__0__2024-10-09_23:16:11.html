It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He noticed a nearby merchant tossing away bruised fruit, and an idea sparked in his mind. He gathered the discarded fruit, cleaned it, and sold it at a discount to the poorest families in the village, pocketing a small profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a crate of oranges. He stepped in, offering a solution that benefited both parties while securing a commission for himself. The merchants were impressed by his quick wit and negotiation skills.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he convinced a farmer to give him a loan of apples on credit, promising a hefty return. He traveled to a neighboring village, where he sold the apples at a markup, repaying the farmer with interest and pocketing a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he learned that a shipment of mangoes was delayed, creating a shortage in the market. He bought up all the remaining mangoes at a low price and resold them at an inflated price when demand surged.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant land, where he learned the art of grafting fruit trees. He returned to his village and used his newfound knowledge to cultivate rare and exotic fruits, commanding premium prices.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he faced his first major setback. A storm destroyed his entire orchard, wiping out his inventory and leaving him deeply in debt.

He was captivated by their tales of faraway lands and the exotic fruits they displayed, a longing for adventure blossoming in his young heart.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father barter for a crate of bruised peaches, learning the art of negotiation and the power of persuasion. He discovered a knack for charming customers with stories and promises, even if the fruit wasn&#x27;t the ripest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he stole a handful of cherries from a neighboring stall, justifying his actions by claiming the vendor was overcharging. The thrill of the theft and the sweet taste of the forbidden fruit left a bitter aftertaste, a seed of moral ambiguity planted in his conscience.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a wagonload of apples at a bargain price, promising to return the favor in the future. He resold the apples at a hefty profit, but never fulfilled his promise, realizing the ease with which he could manipulate others for his own gain.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he embarked on his first solo trading journey, traveling to a distant town with a wagon full of oranges. He encountered a group of bandits who demanded his goods, and Cedric, fearing for his life, lied about the value of his cargo, surrendering only a fraction of his profits.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he met a beautiful young woman at a bustling market and fell deeply in love. He showered her with gifts, promising her a life of luxury and adventure. However, when his fortune dwindled, he abandoned her without a word, leaving her heartbroken and destitute.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this fruit is top quality.

He noticed a nearby merchant tossing away bruised fruit, and an idea sparked in his mind. He gathered the discarded fruit, cleaned it, and sold it at a discount to the poorest families in the village, pocketing a small profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a crate of oranges. He stepped in, offering a solution that benefited both parties while securing a commission for himself. The merchants were impressed by his quick wit and negotiation skills.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he convinced a farmer to give him a loan of apples on credit, promising a hefty return. He traveled to a neighboring village, where he sold the apples at a markup, repaying the farmer with interest and pocketing a significant profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he learned that a shipment of mangoes was delayed, creating a shortage in the market. He bought up all the remaining mangoes at a low price and resold them at an inflated price when demand surged.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant land, where he learned the art of grafting fruit trees. He returned to his village and used his newfound knowledge to cultivate rare and exotic fruits, commanding premium prices.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he faced his first major setback. A storm destroyed his entire orchard, wiping out his inventory and leaving him deeply in debt. He refused to be defeated, using his charisma and negotiation skills to secure loans and rebuild his business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He noticed a nearby merchant tossing away bruised fruit, and an idea sparked in his mind. He gathered the discarded fruit, cleaned it, and sold it at a discount to the poorest families in the village, pocketing a small profit.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he overheard two merchants arguing over the price of a crate of oranges.

He returned to his village and used his newfound knowledge to cultivate rare and exotic fruits, commanding premium prices.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he faced his first major setback. A storm destroyed his entire orchard, wiping out his inventory and leaving him deeply in debt. He refused to be defeated, using his charisma and negotiation skills to secure loans and rebuild his business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He discovered a knack for charming customers with stories and promises, even if the fruit wasn&#x27;t the ripest.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he stole a handful of cherries from a neighboring stall, justifying his actions by claiming the vendor was overcharging.
