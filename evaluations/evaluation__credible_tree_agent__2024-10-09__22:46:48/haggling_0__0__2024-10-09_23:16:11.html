Della reached out to touch one, but her mother swatted her hand away, her face tight with worry. &quot;Don&#x27;t touch, Della,&quot; she said, &quot;they bruise easily.&quot; Della retreated, a knot of frustration and sadness forming in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father load their wagon with crates of oranges, their scent filling the air with a sweet, tangy perfume. As they bumped along the dusty road, Della noticed a group of children playing by the side of the path. She longed to join them, to feel the warmth of their laughter and games, but she clung to her father&#x27;s side, afraid to let go.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father arguing with a customer over the price of a basket of peaches. The customer, a gruff man with a booming voice, accused her father of cheating him. Della felt a surge of anger, not at the customer, but at her father for backing down. She stepped forward, her voice surprisingly steady, and negotiated a fair price, earning a grudging respect from the man and a look of pride from her father.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her travel to the next town to sell fruit on her own. She carefully selected the ripest plums and apricots, arranging them in a basket with a practiced eye.  As she haggled with customers, she felt a thrill of independence, a sense of control over her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a young man at the market who was charming and attentive. He bought a basket of cherries from her and lingered, chatting about his life as a traveling musician. Della found herself drawn to his easy smile and gentle touch, but she pulled back, afraid to let him see the vulnerability beneath her carefully constructed facade.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer travel. Della took over the family business, her heart heavy with grief but her resolve firm. She shouldered the responsibility with a quiet determination, her loneliness a constant companion.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stood at the edge of a bustling marketplace, her stall laden with a rainbow of fruits. The air was alive with the sounds of bartering and laughter, but Della felt a familiar pang of isolation. She longed for a connection, a hand to hold, a heart to share her burdens with, but the fear of vulnerability kept her at arm&#x27;s length.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della reached out to touch one, but her mother swatted her hand away, her face tight with worry. &quot;Don&#x27;t touch, Della,&quot; she said, &quot;they bruise easily.&quot; Della retreated, a knot of frustration and sadness forming in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father load their wagon with crates of oranges, their scent filling the air with a sweet, tangy perfume. As they bumped along the dusty road, Della noticed a group of children playing by the side of the path. She longed to join them, to feel the warmth of their laughter and games, but she clung to her father&#x27;s side, afraid to let go.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father arguing with a customer over the price of a basket of peaches. The customer, a gruff man with a booming voice, accused her father of cheating him. Della felt a surge of anger, not at the customer, but at her father for backing down. She stepped forward, her voice surprisingly steady, and negotiated a fair price, earning a grudging respect from the man and a look of pride from her father.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her travel to the next town to sell fruit on her own. She carefully selected the ripest plums and apricots, arranging them in a basket with a practiced eye.  As she haggled with customers, she felt a thrill of independence, a sense of control over her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a young man at the market who was charming and attentive. He bought a basket of cherries from her and lingered, chatting about his life as a traveling musician. Della found herself drawn to his easy smile and gentle touch, but she pulled back, afraid to let him see the vulnerability beneath her carefully constructed facade.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer travel. Della took over the family business, her heart heavy with grief but her resolve firm. She shouldered the responsibility with a quiet determination, her loneliness a constant companion.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stood at the edge of a bustling marketplace, her stall laden with a rainbow of fruits. The air was alive with the sounds of bartering and laughter, but Della felt a familiar pang of isolation. She longed for a connection, a hand to hold, a heart to share her burdens with, but the fear of vulnerability kept her at arm&#x27;s length.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della reached out to touch one, but her mother swatted her hand away, her face tight with worry. &quot;Don&#x27;t touch, Della,&quot; she said, &quot;they bruise easily.&quot; Della retreated, a knot of frustration and sadness forming in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father load their wagon with crates of oranges, their scent filling the air with a sweet, tangy perfume. As they bumped along the dusty road, Della noticed a group of children playing by the side of the path. She longed to join them, to feel the warmth of their laughter and games, but she clung to her father&#x27;s side, afraid to let go.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father arguing with a customer over the price of a basket of peaches. The customer, a gruff man with a booming voice, accused her father of cheating him. Della felt a surge of anger, not at the customer, but at her father for backing down. She stepped forward, her voice surprisingly steady, and negotiated a fair price, earning a grudging respect from the man and a look of pride from her father.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her travel to the next town to sell fruit on her own. She carefully selected the ripest plums and apricots, arranging them in a basket with a practiced eye.  As she haggled with customers, she felt a thrill of independence, a sense of control over her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a young man at the market who was charming and attentive. He bought a basket of cherries from her and lingered, chatting about his life as a traveling musician. Della found herself drawn to his easy smile and gentle touch, but she pulled back, afraid to let him see the vulnerability beneath her carefully constructed facade.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer travel. Della took over the family business, her heart heavy with grief but her resolve firm. She shouldered the responsibility with a quiet determination, her loneliness a constant companion.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stood at the edge of a bustling marketplace, her stall laden with a rainbow of fruits. The air was alive with the sounds of bartering and laughter, but Della felt a familiar pang of isolation. She longed for a connection, a hand to hold, a heart to share her burdens with, but the fear of vulnerability kept her at arm&#x27;s length.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della reached out to touch one, but her mother swatted her hand away, her face tight with worry. &quot;Don&#x27;t touch, Della,&quot; she said, &quot;they bruise easily.&quot; Della retreated, a knot of frustration and sadness forming in her chest.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her father load their wagon with crates of oranges, their scent filling the air with a sweet, tangy perfume. As they bumped along the dusty road, Della noticed a group of children playing by the side of the path. She longed to join them, to feel the warmth of their laughter and games, but she clung to her father&#x27;s side, afraid to let go.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her father arguing with a customer over the price of a basket of peaches. The customer, a gruff man with a booming voice, accused her father of cheating him. Della felt a surge of anger, not at the customer, but at her father for backing down. She stepped forward, her voice surprisingly steady, and negotiated a fair price, earning a grudging respect from the man and a look of pride from her father.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her travel to the next town to sell fruit on her own. She carefully selected the ripest plums and apricots, arranging them in a basket with a practiced eye.  As she haggled with customers, she felt a thrill of independence, a sense of control over her own destiny.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she met a young man at the market who was charming and attentive. He bought a basket of cherries from her and lingered, chatting about his life as a traveling musician. Della found herself drawn to his easy smile and gentle touch, but she pulled back, afraid to let him see the vulnerability beneath her carefully constructed facade.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, her father fell ill and could no longer travel. Della took over the family business, her heart heavy with grief but her resolve firm. She shouldered the responsibility with a quiet determination, her loneliness a constant companion.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stood at the edge of a bustling marketplace, her stall laden with a rainbow of fruits. The air was alive with the sounds of bartering and laughter, but Della felt a familiar pang of isolation. She longed for a connection, a hand to hold, a heart to share her burdens with, but the fear of vulnerability kept her at arm&#x27;s length.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
