You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

During a game of marbles, a boy named Thomas accused Lennon of cheating and took all of Lennon&#x27;s marbles, leaving Lennon empty-handed and seething with resentment. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to never be cheated again, even if it meant resorting to underhanded tactics.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, being taken advantage of by a wealthy landowner. The landowner offered a pittance for their father&#x27;s finest apples, exploiting his desperation. Lennon watched, powerless and furious, as their father accepted the unfair deal, his shoulders slumping under the weight of circumstance. The injustice of it all burned into Lennon&#x27;s memory, fueling a growing distrust of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell apples at the local market. Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.  It was a small act of rebellion, a way to exert control in a world that often felt stacked against them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard villagers gossiping about their family, whispering about their poverty and their father&#x27;s misfortunes. The words stung like salt in a wound, leaving Lennon feeling isolated and embittered. They vowed to prove those gossipers wrong, to amass a fortune and show them all that they were not to be pitied.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant. They traveled from town to town, their cart laden with apples, pears, and plums, each piece of fruit a potential weapon in their arsenal of petty revenge.  Lennon relished the anonymity of the road, the freedom to exact their own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of merchants who tried to cheat them out of a good deal on a shipment of oranges. Lennon, however, had learned from the best, and they outsmarted the merchants, driving a hard bargain and walking away with a profit. The victory, though small, filled Lennon with a sense of satisfaction, reinforcing their belief that the world was a battlefield and they were determined to win.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She knew it was wrong, but the sweetness on her tongue was a revelation, a secret joy she vowed to protect.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she bartered a handful of wild berries for a chipped teacup, a deal that left the other child bewildered but Della triumphant.

She knew it was wrong, but the sweetness on her tongue was a revelation, a secret joy she vowed to protect.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she bartered a handful of wild berries for a chipped teacup, a deal that left the other child bewildered but Della triumphant. The thrill of outsmarting someone, of getting something for seemingly nothing, filled her with a strange exhilaration.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard her parents arguing about money, their voices laced with desperation. That night, Della snuck out and sold a basket of apples she had gathered, hiding the meager earnings beneath her floorboards. It was the first time she tasted the bitter tang of responsibility, the weight of providing for herself.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a traveling merchant to let her work for him, her youthful enthusiasm masking a shrewd mind. She learned the art of persuasion, the power of a well-placed word, the delicate dance of supply and demand.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she traveled alone for the first time, her cart laden with apples and pears. The freedom of the open road was intoxicating, but the loneliness was a constant ache, a reminder of the distance she kept from others.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she returned home after a successful season, her pockets heavy with coins. Her parents were overjoyed, but Della felt a hollowness within her, a realization that material wealth couldn&#x27;t fill the void in her heart.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

During a game of marbles, a boy named Thomas accused Lennon of cheating and took all of Lennon&#x27;s marbles, leaving Lennon empty-handed and seething with resentment. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to never be cheated again, even if it meant resorting to underhanded tactics.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, being taken advantage of by a wealthy landowner. The landowner offered a pittance for their father&#x27;s finest apples, exploiting his desperation. Lennon watched, powerless and furious, as their father accepted the unfair deal, his shoulders slumping under the weight of circumstance. The injustice of it all burned into Lennon&#x27;s memory, fueling a growing distrust of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell apples at the local market. Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.  It was a small act of rebellion, a way to exert control in a world that often felt stacked against them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard villagers gossiping about their family, whispering about their poverty and their father&#x27;s misfortunes. The words stung like salt in a wound, leaving Lennon feeling isolated and embittered. They vowed to prove those gossipers wrong, to amass a fortune and show them all that they were not to be pitied.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant. They traveled from town to town, their cart laden with apples, pears, and plums, each piece of fruit a potential weapon in their arsenal of petty revenge.  Lennon relished the anonymity of the road, the freedom to exact their own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of merchants who tried to cheat them out of a good deal on a shipment of oranges. Lennon, however, had learned from the best, and they outsmarted the merchants, driving a hard bargain and walking away with a profit. The victory, though small, filled Lennon with a sense of satisfaction, reinforcing their belief that the world was a battlefield and they were determined to win.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

During a game of marbles, a boy named Thomas accused Lennon of cheating and took all of Lennon&#x27;s marbles, leaving Lennon empty-handed and seething with resentment. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to never be cheated again, even if it meant resorting to underhanded tactics.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, being taken advantage of by a wealthy landowner. The landowner offered a pittance for their father&#x27;s finest apples, exploiting his desperation. Lennon watched, powerless and furious, as their father accepted the unfair deal, his shoulders slumping under the weight of circumstance. The injustice of it all burned into Lennon&#x27;s memory, fueling a growing distrust of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell apples at the local market. Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.  It was a small act of rebellion, a way to exert control in a world that often felt stacked against them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard villagers gossiping about their family, whispering about their poverty and their father&#x27;s misfortunes. The words stung like salt in a wound, leaving Lennon feeling isolated and embittered. They vowed to prove those gossipers wrong, to amass a fortune and show them all that they were not to be pitied.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant. They traveled from town to town, their cart laden with apples, pears, and plums, each piece of fruit a potential weapon in their arsenal of petty revenge.  Lennon relished the anonymity of the road, the freedom to exact their own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of merchants who tried to cheat them out of a good deal on a shipment of oranges. Lennon, however, had learned from the best, and they outsmarted the merchants, driving a hard bargain and walking away with a profit. The victory, though small, filled Lennon with a sense of satisfaction, reinforcing their belief that the world was a battlefield and they were determined to win.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He followed the sound for what felt like hours, his small legs aching, until he reached a bustling marketplace filled with exotic sights and smells. The vibrant colors and unfamiliar faces filled him with a sense of wonder, and he vowed to one day see the world beyond his village.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. He was fascinated by the art of bargaining, watching his father expertly negotiate prices and build rapport with customers. Cedric, a natural charmer, found himself drawn to the social aspect of commerce, his young mind already dreaming of a life of travel and trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a prized apple tree, struck down by a sudden storm. Cedric, filled with a sense of responsibility, spent days researching grafting techniques and meticulously nursed a sapling back to health. The experience instilled in him a deep respect for nature&#x27;s bounty and a determination to overcome adversity.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he secretly sold some of his father&#x27;s apples at a neighboring village, using the profits to buy himself a worn map of the world. The thrill of independence and the allure of the unknown fueled his desire to break free from the confines of his predictable life.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he finally confronted his father about his yearning to travel. The conversation ended in a heated argument, leaving Cedric feeling misunderstood and resentful. He packed his meager belongings, a knapsack filled with apples and dreams, and set off into the world, determined to prove himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned merchant who taught him the intricacies of the fruit trade.

He followed the sound for what felt like hours, his small legs aching, until he reached a bustling marketplace filled with exotic sights and smells. The vibrant colors and unfamiliar faces filled him with a sense of wonder, and he vowed to one day see the world beyond his village.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. He was fascinated by the art of bargaining, watching his father expertly negotiate prices and build rapport with customers. Cedric, a natural charmer, found himself drawn to the social aspect of commerce, his young mind already dreaming of a life of travel and trade.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard his father lamenting the loss of a prized apple tree, struck down by a sudden storm. Cedric, filled with a sense of responsibility, spent days researching grafting techniques and meticulously nursed a sapling back to health. The experience instilled in him a deep respect for nature&#x27;s bounty and a determination to overcome adversity.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he secretly sold some of his father&#x27;s apples at a neighboring village, using the profits to buy himself a worn map of the world. The thrill of independence and the allure of the unknown fueled his desire to break free from the confines of his predictable life.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he finally confronted his father about his yearning to travel. The conversation ended in a heated argument, leaving Cedric feeling misunderstood and resentful. He packed his meager belongings, a knapsack filled with apples and dreams, and set off into the world, determined to prove himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned merchant who taught him the intricacies of the fruit trade. He learned about different varieties, their growing seasons, and the art of preserving them for long journeys.

The landowner offered a pittance for their father&#x27;s finest apples, exploiting his desperation. Lennon watched, powerless and furious, as their father accepted the unfair deal, his shoulders slumping under the weight of circumstance. The injustice of it all burned into Lennon&#x27;s memory, fueling a growing distrust of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell apples at the local market. Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.  It was a small act of rebellion, a way to exert control in a world that often felt stacked against them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard villagers gossiping about their family, whispering about their poverty and their father&#x27;s misfortunes. The words stung like salt in a wound, leaving Lennon feeling isolated and embittered. They vowed to prove those gossipers wrong, to amass a fortune and show them all that they were not to be pitied.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant. They traveled from town to town, their cart laden with apples, pears, and plums, each piece of fruit a potential weapon in their arsenal of petty revenge.  Lennon relished the anonymity of the road, the freedom to exact their own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of merchants who tried to cheat them out of a good deal on a shipment of oranges. Lennon, however, had learned from the best, and they outsmarted the merchants, driving a hard bargain and walking away with a profit. The victory, though small, filled Lennon with a sense of satisfaction, reinforcing their belief that the world was a battlefield and they were determined to win.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are prime quality.

Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.  It was a small act of rebellion, a way to exert control in a world that often felt stacked against them.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant. They traveled from town to town, their cart laden with apples, pears, and plums, each piece of fruit a potential weapon in their arsenal of petty revenge.  Lennon relished the anonymity of the road, the freedom to exact their own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

During a game of marbles, a boy named Thomas accused Lennon of cheating and took all of Lennon&#x27;s marbles, leaving Lennon empty-handed and seething with resentment. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to never be cheated again, even if it meant resorting to underhanded tactics.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, being taken advantage of by a wealthy landowner. The landowner offered a pittance for their father&#x27;s finest apples, exploiting his desperation. Lennon watched, powerless and furious, as their father accepted the unfair deal, his shoulders slumping under the weight of circumstance. The injustice of it all burned into Lennon&#x27;s memory, fueling a growing distrust of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell apples at the local market. Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.  It was a small act of rebellion, a way to exert control in a world that often felt stacked against them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard villagers gossiping about their family, whispering about their poverty and their father&#x27;s misfortunes. The words stung like salt in a wound, leaving Lennon feeling isolated and embittered. They vowed to prove those gossipers wrong, to amass a fortune and show them all that they were not to be pitied.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant. They traveled from town to town, their cart laden with apples, pears, and plums, each piece of fruit a potential weapon in their arsenal of petty revenge.  Lennon relished the anonymity of the road, the freedom to exact their own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of merchants who tried to cheat them out of a good deal on a shipment of oranges. Lennon, however, had learned from the best, and they outsmarted the merchants, driving a hard bargain and walking away with a profit. The victory, though small, filled Lennon with a sense of satisfaction, reinforcing their belief that the world was a battlefield and they were determined to win.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She knew it was wrong, but the sweetness on her tongue was a revelation, a secret joy she vowed to protect.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she bartered a handful of wild berries for a chipped teacup, a deal that left the other child bewildered but Della triumphant.

He followed the sound for what felt like hours, his small legs aching, until he reached a bustling marketplace filled with exotic sights and smells. The vibrant colors and unfamiliar faces filled him with a sense of wonder, and he vowed to one day see the world beyond his village.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market.

The conversation ended in a heated argument, leaving Cedric feeling misunderstood and resentful.

The landowner offered a pittance for their father&#x27;s finest apples, exploiting his desperation. Lennon watched, powerless and furious, as their father accepted the unfair deal, his shoulders slumping under the weight of circumstance. The injustice of it all burned into Lennon&#x27;s memory, fueling a growing distrust of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell apples at the local market. Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.  It was a small act of rebellion, a way to exert control in a world that often felt stacked against them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard villagers gossiping about their family, whispering about their poverty and their father&#x27;s misfortunes. The words stung like salt in a wound, leaving Lennon feeling isolated and embittered. They vowed to prove those gossipers wrong, to amass a fortune and show them all that they were not to be pitied.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant. They traveled from town to town, their cart laden with apples, pears, and plums, each piece of fruit a potential weapon in their arsenal of petty revenge.  Lennon relished the anonymity of the road, the freedom to exact their own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of merchants who tried to cheat them out of a good deal on a shipment of oranges. Lennon, however, had learned from the best, and they outsmarted the merchants, driving a hard bargain and walking away with a profit. The victory, though small, filled Lennon with a sense of satisfaction, reinforcing their belief that the world was a battlefield and they were determined to win.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are prime quality.

During a game of marbles, a boy named Thomas accused Lennon of cheating and took all of Lennon&#x27;s marbles, leaving Lennon empty-handed and seething with resentment. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to never be cheated again, even if it meant resorting to underhanded tactics.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, being taken advantage of by a wealthy landowner. The landowner offered a pittance for their father&#x27;s finest apples, exploiting his desperation. Lennon watched, powerless and furious, as their father accepted the unfair deal, his shoulders slumping under the weight of circumstance. The injustice of it all burned into Lennon&#x27;s memory, fueling a growing distrust of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell apples at the local market. Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.  It was a small act of rebellion, a way to exert control in a world that often felt stacked against them.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they overheard villagers gossiping about their family, whispering about their poverty and their father&#x27;s misfortunes. The words stung like salt in a wound, leaving Lennon feeling isolated and embittered. They vowed to prove those gossipers wrong, to amass a fortune and show them all that they were not to be pitied.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant. They traveled from town to town, their cart laden with apples, pears, and plums, each piece of fruit a potential weapon in their arsenal of petty revenge.  Lennon relished the anonymity of the road, the freedom to exact their own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of merchants who tried to cheat them out of a good deal on a shipment of oranges. Lennon, however, had learned from the best, and they outsmarted the merchants, driving a hard bargain and walking away with a profit. The victory, though small, filled Lennon with a sense of satisfaction, reinforcing their belief that the world was a battlefield and they were determined to win.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The landowner offered a pittance for their father&#x27;s finest apples, exploiting his desperation. Lennon watched, powerless and furious, as their father accepted the unfair deal, his shoulders slumping under the weight of circumstance. The injustice of it all burned into Lennon&#x27;s memory, fueling a growing distrust of others.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their mother sell apples at the local market. Lennon quickly learned the art of haggling, but they took a perverse pleasure in shortchanging customers, especially those who seemed arrogant or entitled.

The words stung like salt in a wound, leaving Lennon feeling isolated and embittered. They vowed to prove those gossipers wrong, to amass a fortune and show them all that they were not to be pitied.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a traveling fruit merchant.

He followed the sound for what felt like hours, his small legs aching, until he reached a bustling marketplace filled with exotic sights and smells. The vibrant colors and unfamiliar faces filled him with a sense of wonder, and he vowed to one day see the world beyond his village.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.
