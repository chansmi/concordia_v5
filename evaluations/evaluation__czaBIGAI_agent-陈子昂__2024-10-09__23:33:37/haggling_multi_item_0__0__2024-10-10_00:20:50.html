You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Della Plumstone can continue negotiating with Lennon Figtree to buy fruit.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[28 Oct 1872 00:00:00] <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 6 years old, she watched her mother meticulously arrange plums in their stall, each one a jewel glistening under the morning sun. Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, tempted by the prospect of financial security, hesitated, remembering her mother&#x27;s longing for a life of luxury. She ultimately declined the offer, choosing instead to continue her journey, haunted by the fear that success would only lead to further disappointments.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The other children laughed, their cruel taunts echoing in his ears, and Lennon vowed never to be vulnerable again. He would build a wall around himself, a shield of bluster and bravado to keep the world at bay.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he overheard his father negotiating a deal with a shrewd customer, his voice calm and persuasive. Lennon watched, mesmerized, as his father secured a favorable price, his words a weapon wielded with precision and grace. That day, Lennon decided he would be a trader, a master of words and commerce, a force to be reckoned with.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he attempted to haggle for a basket of peaches, his voice trembling with uncertainty. The vendor, a burly man with a booming laugh, saw through Lennon&#x27;s facade and refused to budge on the price. Humiliated and defeated, Lennon retreated, vowing to never show weakness again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a reluctant farmer to sell him a crate of rare, exotic mangoes at a bargain price.

He traveled from town to town, his voice booming through the marketplace, his sharp tongue and even sharper prices earning him both admiration and resentment.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he lost a significant sum of money in a risky trade, the weight of his failure crushing him.

The other children laughed, their cruel taunts echoing in his ears, and Lennon vowed never to be vulnerable again. He would build a wall around himself, a shield of bluster and bravado to keep the world at bay.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he overheard his father negotiating a deal with a shrewd customer, his voice calm and persuasive. Lennon watched, mesmerized, as his father secured a favorable price, his words a weapon wielded with precision and grace. That day, Lennon decided he would be a trader, a master of words and commerce, a force to be reckoned with.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he attempted to haggle for a basket of peaches, his voice trembling with uncertainty. The vendor, a burly man with a booming laugh, saw through Lennon&#x27;s facade and refused to budge on the price. Humiliated and defeated, Lennon retreated, vowing to never show weakness again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a reluctant farmer to sell him a crate of rare, exotic mangoes at a bargain price. The farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s audacity and quick wit, agreed to the deal, and Lennon felt a surge of pride. For the first time, he tasted the sweetness of success, the thrill of outsmarting someone, and he craved more.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, his cart laden with fruit and his heart filled with ambition. He traveled from town to town, his voice booming through the marketplace, his sharp tongue and even sharper prices earning him both admiration and resentment.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he lost a significant sum of money in a risky trade, the weight of his failure crushing him. He retreated to his inn room, the silence amplifying his self-doubt, and for the first time, he questioned his path, wondering if he was destined to be forever haunted by the fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round.

However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, tempted by the prospect of financial security, hesitated, remembering her mother&#x27;s longing for a life of luxury. She ultimately declined the offer, choosing instead to continue her journey, haunted by the fear that success would only lead to further disappointments.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The other children laughed, their cruel taunts echoing in his ears, and Lennon vowed never to be vulnerable again. He would build a wall around himself, a shield of bluster and bravado to keep the world at bay.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he overheard his father negotiating a deal with a shrewd customer, his voice calm and persuasive. Lennon watched, mesmerized, as his father secured a favorable price, his words a weapon wielded with precision and grace. That day, Lennon decided he would be a trader, a master of words and commerce, a force to be reckoned with.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he attempted to haggle for a basket of peaches, his voice trembling with uncertainty. The vendor, a burly man with a booming laugh, saw through Lennon&#x27;s facade and refused to budge on the price. Humiliated and defeated, Lennon retreated, vowing to never show weakness again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a reluctant farmer to sell him a crate of rare, exotic mangoes at a bargain price. The farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s audacity and quick wit, agreed to the deal, and Lennon felt a surge of pride. For the first time, he tasted the sweetness of success, the thrill of outsmarting someone, and he craved more.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, his cart laden with fruit and his heart filled with ambition. He traveled from town to town, his voice booming through the marketplace, his sharp tongue and even sharper prices earning him both admiration and resentment.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he lost a significant sum of money in a risky trade, the weight of his failure crushing him. He retreated to his inn room, the silence amplifying his self-doubt, and for the first time, he questioned his path, wondering if he was destined to be forever haunted by the fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, tempted by the prospect of financial security, hesitated, remembering her mother&#x27;s longing for a life of luxury. She ultimately declined the offer, choosing instead to continue her journey, haunted by the fear that success would only lead to further disappointments.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round.

Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit.

He tried to trade his prized wooden toy soldier for his neighbor&#x27;s apple, but the neighbor refused, deeming the soldier unworthy. Cedric stormed off, tears welling in his eyes, vowing to never be taken advantage of again.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed his father&#x27;s temper erupt after a hailstorm destroyed their apple crop. The sight of his father’s despair fueled Cedric’s own anger, and he lashed out at the sky, screaming at the injustice of it all.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck away from his chores to eavesdrop on the traveling merchants who visited the village. He was captivated by their stories of faraway lands and exotic fruits, and he vowed to one day join their ranks.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him help sell his surplus peaches at the market. Cedric’s enthusiasm and persuasive skills impressed the farmer, who gave him a small cut of the profits. This first taste of success fueled Cedric’s ambition to become a merchant himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he faced his first major setback as a traveling fruit merchant. A shipment of oranges spoiled during a particularly harsh winter, leaving Cedric with a significant financial loss. The experience taught him the importance of careful planning and risk management.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he successfully negotiated a lucrative deal with a wealthy merchant in a neighboring town. Cedric’s sharp bargaining skills and charisma impressed the merchant, who became a valuable business partner.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, tempted by the prospect of financial security, hesitated, remembering her mother&#x27;s longing for a life of luxury. She ultimately declined the offer, choosing instead to continue her journey, haunted by the fear that success would only lead to further disappointments.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round.

While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, tempted by the prospect of financial security, hesitated, remembering her mother&#x27;s longing for a life of luxury. She ultimately declined the offer, choosing instead to continue her journey, haunted by the fear that success would only lead to further disappointments.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round.

However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price.

He tried to trade his prized wooden toy soldier for his neighbor&#x27;s apple, but the neighbor refused, deeming the soldier unworthy. Cedric stormed off, tears welling in his eyes, vowing to never be taken advantage of again.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he witnessed his father&#x27;s temper erupt after a hailstorm destroyed their apple crop. The sight of his father’s despair fueled Cedric’s own anger, and he lashed out at the sky, screaming at the injustice of it all.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he snuck away from his chores to eavesdrop on the traveling merchants who visited the village. He was captivated by their stories of faraway lands and exotic fruits, and he vowed to one day join their ranks.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a local farmer to let him help sell his surplus peaches at the market. Cedric’s enthusiasm and persuasive skills impressed the farmer, who gave him a small cut of the profits. This first taste of success fueled Cedric’s ambition to become a merchant himself.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he faced his first major setback as a traveling fruit merchant. A shipment of oranges spoiled during a particularly harsh winter, leaving Cedric with a significant financial loss. The experience taught him the importance of careful planning and risk management.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he successfully negotiated a lucrative deal with a wealthy merchant in a neighboring town. Cedric’s sharp bargaining skills and charisma impressed the merchant, who became a valuable business partner.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, tempted by the prospect of financial security, hesitated, remembering her mother&#x27;s longing for a life of luxury. She ultimately declined the offer, choosing instead to continue her journey, haunted by the fear that success would only lead to further disappointments.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round.

However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price.

Della carefully picked up a bruised plum, its skin marred but its flesh still sweet, and offered it to a customer for a pittance. Her mother, however, swiftly snatched it away, scolding Della for undervaluing their goods.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from the bustling market to explore the quiet back alleys. She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, tempted by the prospect of financial security, hesitated, remembering her mother&#x27;s longing for a life of luxury. She ultimately declined the offer, choosing instead to continue her journey, haunted by the fear that success would only lead to further disappointments.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The other children laughed, their cruel taunts echoing in his ears, and Lennon vowed never to be vulnerable again. He would build a wall around himself, a shield of bluster and bravado to keep the world at bay.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he overheard his father negotiating a deal with a shrewd customer, his voice calm and persuasive.

The other children laughed, their cruel taunts echoing in his ears, and Lennon vowed never to be vulnerable again. He would build a wall around himself, a shield of bluster and bravado to keep the world at bay.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he overheard his father negotiating a deal with a shrewd customer, his voice calm and persuasive. Lennon watched, mesmerized, as his father secured a favorable price, his words a weapon wielded with precision and grace. That day, Lennon decided he would be a trader, a master of words and commerce, a force to be reckoned with.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he attempted to haggle for a basket of peaches, his voice trembling with uncertainty. The vendor, a burly man with a booming laugh, saw through Lennon&#x27;s facade and refused to budge on the price. Humiliated and defeated, Lennon retreated, vowing to never show weakness again.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he convinced a reluctant farmer to sell him a crate of rare, exotic mangoes at a bargain price. The farmer, impressed by Lennon&#x27;s audacity and quick wit, agreed to the deal, and Lennon felt a surge of pride. For the first time, he tasted the sweetness of success, the thrill of outsmarting someone, and he craved more.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he set out on his own, his cart laden with fruit and his heart filled with ambition. He traveled from town to town, his voice booming through the marketplace, his sharp tongue and even sharper prices earning him both admiration and resentment.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he lost a significant sum of money in a risky trade, the weight of his failure crushing him. He retreated to his inn room, the silence amplifying his self-doubt, and for the first time, he questioned his path, wondering if he was destined to be forever haunted by the fear of failure.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She stumbled upon a hidden garden, a secret oasis bursting with ripe fruit trees. Della filled her pockets with fallen apples and pears, a treasure trove she planned to share with her mother, only to be met with disappointment when her mother refused to accept anything &quot;given away.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard two merchants discussing a distant land where fruit grew in abundance year-round. Della, captivated by the idea of a place where fruit was plentiful and readily available, dreamt of escaping the confines of their small town and traveling to this bountiful paradise.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell their surplus fruit. Della, brimming with newfound confidence, negotiated prices with shrewdness and charm, earning more than she had ever imagined. However, upon returning home, her mother dismissed her success as mere luck, reminding Della that true wealth lay in silks and fine china, not perishable fruit.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she used her savings to buy a small cart and set out on her own, traveling from town to town, selling fruit. While she relished the freedom of the open road and the satisfaction of building her own business, she couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that she was betraying her mother&#x27;s dreams.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a wealthy merchant who offered to buy her entire stock of fruit at an exorbitant price. Della, tempted by the prospect of financial security, hesitated, remembering her mother&#x27;s longing for a life of luxury.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
