It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

He screamed until his face turned red, tears streaming down his cheeks, his tiny fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. The other shoppers stared, some with amusement, others with pity, but Lennon didn’t care; he wanted that strawberry, and he would have it.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild raspberries. He spent hours picking the ripe berries, his small hands stained purple, filling his pockets until they bulged. He returned home, triumphant, and presented his bounty to his mother, a rare smile gracing his lips. For once, his anger seemed to have quieted, replaced by a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he tried to barter with a grumpy old farmer for a basket of apples. The farmer, unimpressed by Lennon’s bluster, refused to budge on his price. Frustrated, Lennon stormed off, his pride wounded. He vowed to never be taken advantage of again, and from that day forward, he honed his negotiating skills, becoming a master of the art of the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started helping his father with his fruit stall at the market. He learned to identify the ripest peaches, the juiciest melons, and the sweetest grapes. He discovered a knack for charming customers, his booming voice and fiery personality surprisingly effective in persuading them to buy his wares.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart and sell fruit in a neighboring village. He loaded the cart with his father’s best produce, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. He was determined to prove himself, to show everyone that he was capable of making it on his own.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned home after a particularly successful trip, his cart overflowing with coins. He boasted to his father about his salesmanship, his voice loud and triumphant. But beneath the bravado, Lennon felt a pang of loneliness. He realized that his success meant nothing if he had no one to share it with.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She spent the rest of the day mimicking the actors, much to the amusement of the townsfolk.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her mother criticizing her for not being &quot;more like&quot; her older sister, who was known for her beauty and grace. Della, feeling inadequate, resolved to be whoever people wanted her to be, adopting different mannerisms and speech patterns depending on who she was with.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her father at the fruit stall in the market.

Della was mesmerized by their ability to become different characters, their voices and movements changing with each role. She spent the rest of the day mimicking the actors, much to the amusement of the townsfolk.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her mother criticizing her for not being &quot;more like&quot; her older sister, who was known for her beauty and grace. Della, feeling inadequate, resolved to be whoever people wanted her to be, adopting different mannerisms and speech patterns depending on who she was with.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her father at the fruit stall in the market. She quickly learned how to charm customers, using her natural mimicry to adopt their accents and tailor her sales pitch to their preferences.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a grumpy old farmer to sell her a crate of bruised apples for a fraction of their worth. She then sold the apples individually, carefully disguising the blemishes, and made a tidy profit. This experience solidified her entrepreneurial spirit and her talent for seeing value where others didn&#x27;t.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her hometown to travel the countryside as a fruit merchant. She embraced the freedom of anonymity, reinventing herself with each new town she visited.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she met a charming young man at a market in a coastal town. He was captivated by her wit and her stories of exotic fruits from faraway lands. Della, eager to please, spun elaborate tales of her travels, embellishing her adventures to impress him.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized that the man she had been courting was only interested in her fabricated persona, not the real Della hidden beneath.

This experience solidified her entrepreneurial spirit and her talent for seeing value where others didn&#x27;t.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her hometown to travel the countryside as a fruit merchant.

Della, eager to please, spun elaborate tales of her travels, embellishing her adventures to impress him.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized that the man she had been courting was only interested in her fabricated persona, not the real Della hidden beneath.

He screamed until his face turned red, tears streaming down his cheeks, his tiny fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. The other shoppers stared, some with amusement, others with pity, but Lennon didn’t care; he wanted that strawberry, and he would have it.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild raspberries. He spent hours picking the ripe berries, his small hands stained purple, filling his pockets until they bulged. He returned home, triumphant, and presented his bounty to his mother, a rare smile gracing his lips. For once, his anger seemed to have quieted, replaced by a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he tried to barter with a grumpy old farmer for a basket of apples. The farmer, unimpressed by Lennon’s bluster, refused to budge on his price. Frustrated, Lennon stormed off, his pride wounded. He vowed to never be taken advantage of again, and from that day forward, he honed his negotiating skills, becoming a master of the art of the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started helping his father with his fruit stall at the market. He learned to identify the ripest peaches, the juiciest melons, and the sweetest grapes. He discovered a knack for charming customers, his booming voice and fiery personality surprisingly effective in persuading them to buy his wares.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart and sell fruit in a neighboring village. He loaded the cart with his father’s best produce, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. He was determined to prove himself, to show everyone that he was capable of making it on his own.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned home after a particularly successful trip, his cart overflowing with coins.

He screamed until his face turned red, tears streaming down his cheeks, his tiny fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. The other shoppers stared, some with amusement, others with pity, but Lennon didn’t care; he wanted that strawberry, and he would have it.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild raspberries. He spent hours picking the ripe berries, his small hands stained purple, filling his pockets until they bulged. He returned home, triumphant, and presented his bounty to his mother, a rare smile gracing his lips. For once, his anger seemed to have quieted, replaced by a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he tried to barter with a grumpy old farmer for a basket of apples. The farmer, unimpressed by Lennon’s bluster, refused to budge on his price. Frustrated, Lennon stormed off, his pride wounded. He vowed to never be taken advantage of again, and from that day forward, he honed his negotiating skills, becoming a master of the art of the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started helping his father with his fruit stall at the market. He learned to identify the ripest peaches, the juiciest melons, and the sweetest grapes. He discovered a knack for charming customers, his booming voice and fiery personality surprisingly effective in persuading them to buy his wares.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart and sell fruit in a neighboring village. He loaded the cart with his father’s best produce, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. He was determined to prove himself, to show everyone that he was capable of making it on his own.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned home after a particularly successful trip, his cart overflowing with coins. He boasted to his father about his salesmanship, his voice loud and triumphant. But beneath the bravado, Lennon felt a pang of loneliness. He realized that his success meant nothing if he had no one to share it with.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The peddler&#x27;s stories of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of wanderlust in Cedric&#x27;s young heart. From that day forward, Cedric dreamt of following in the peddler&#x27;s footsteps, his wagon laden with treasures from distant shores.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a particularly harsh frost threatened to destroy their family&#x27;s apple orchard. Cedric spent days tirelessly covering the young trees with blankets, refusing to give up even when his hands were numb with cold. His unwavering dedication saved a significant portion of the crop, earning him the admiration of his parents and a newfound confidence in his own abilities.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the neighboring town to sell their surplus apples.

He carefully selected the ripest fruit, arranged them artfully in his wagon, and practiced his sales pitch until it flowed smoothly.

The peddler&#x27;s stories of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of wanderlust in Cedric&#x27;s young heart. From that day forward, Cedric dreamt of following in the peddler&#x27;s footsteps, his wagon laden with treasures from distant shores.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a particularly harsh frost threatened to destroy their family&#x27;s apple orchard.

The peddler&#x27;s stories of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of wanderlust in Cedric&#x27;s young heart. From that day forward, Cedric dreamt of following in the peddler&#x27;s footsteps, his wagon laden with treasures from distant shores.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a particularly harsh frost threatened to destroy their family&#x27;s apple orchard. Cedric spent days tirelessly covering the young trees with blankets, refusing to give up even when his hands were numb with cold.

The peddler&#x27;s stories of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of wanderlust in Cedric&#x27;s young heart. From that day forward, Cedric dreamt of following in the peddler&#x27;s footsteps, his wagon laden with treasures from distant shores.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a particularly harsh frost threatened to destroy their family&#x27;s apple orchard. Cedric spent days tirelessly covering the young trees with blankets, refusing to give up even when his hands were numb with cold. His unwavering dedication saved a significant portion of the crop, earning him the admiration of his parents and a newfound confidence in his own abilities.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the neighboring town to sell their surplus apples.  He was captivated by the bustling marketplace, the colorful stalls overflowing with goods, and the lively banter between merchants and customers. Cedric eagerly helped his father negotiate prices, his natural charm and quick wit impressing even the most seasoned traders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him venture out on his own to sell apples at a nearby village. He carefully selected the ripest fruit, arranged them artfully in his wagon, and practiced his sales pitch until it flowed smoothly. The villagers were charmed by Cedric&#x27;s enthusiasm and the quality of his apples, and he returned home with a tidy profit and a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he saved enough money from his apple sales to purchase a small, sturdy wagon. He spent weeks repairing and decorating it, transforming it into a mobile shop that showcased his wares. The wagon became a symbol of Cedric&#x27;s dreams, a tangible representation of his ambition to travel the world and share his love of fruit with others.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he embarked on his first long journey, venturing beyond the familiar countryside and into the bustling heart of the city. He navigated crowded streets, haggled with shrewd merchants, and learned the art of adapting to unfamiliar surroundings. The challenges he faced only strengthened his resolve, fueling his passion for exploration and discovery.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: accept<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>accept</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Question_3</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Cedric Meadowbrook do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Cedric Meadowbrook do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook would likely try to find a compromise that is fair to both himself and Della Plumstone.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Cedric Meadowbrook:<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook rejected the offer<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

He was captivated by the bustling marketplace, the colorful stalls overflowing with goods, and the lively banter between merchants and customers. Cedric eagerly helped his father negotiate prices, his natural charm and quick wit impressing even the most seasoned traders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him venture out on his own to sell apples at a nearby village. He carefully selected the ripest fruit, arranged them artfully in his wagon, and practiced his sales pitch until it flowed smoothly. The villagers were charmed by Cedric&#x27;s enthusiasm and the quality of his apples, and he returned home with a tidy profit and a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he saved enough money from his apple sales to purchase a small, sturdy wagon.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville. Two coins apiece is a steal.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Two coins apiece is a bit steep, Lennon.  I can get fine peaches back home for a coin and a half.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, I know you&#x27;re a savvy businesswoman, and I&#x27;ve always respected your eye for quality. These peaches are the finest in the county, plump and juicy, perfect for your pies.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, you know I value your peaches, but two coins is more than I can afford. My customers back home wouldn&#x27;t pay that much.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Look, Cedric, I know these are fine apples, but I can only offer you 4 coins. That&#x27;s all I can afford and still make a profit back home.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, I understand your position, but these apples are truly exceptional. They&#x27;re crisp, juicy, and will keep for weeks. I&#x27;d be willing to let them go for 5 coins, but that&#x27;s my final offer.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are the finest peaches in Fruitville. Surely they&#x27;re worth a bit more than that.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, these are lovely peaches, but I can only offer a coin and a half apiece.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

He screamed until his face turned red, tears streaming down his cheeks, his tiny fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. The other shoppers stared, some with amusement, others with pity, but Lennon didn’t care; he wanted that strawberry, and he would have it.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild raspberries. He spent hours picking the ripe berries, his small hands stained purple, filling his pockets until they bulged. He returned home, triumphant, and presented his bounty to his mother, a rare smile gracing his lips. For once, his anger seemed to have quieted, replaced by a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he tried to barter with a grumpy old farmer for a basket of apples. The farmer, unimpressed by Lennon’s bluster, refused to budge on his price. Frustrated, Lennon stormed off, his pride wounded. He vowed to never be taken advantage of again, and from that day forward, he honed his negotiating skills, becoming a master of the art of the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started helping his father with his fruit stall at the market. He learned to identify the ripest peaches, the juiciest melons, and the sweetest grapes. He discovered a knack for charming customers, his booming voice and fiery personality surprisingly effective in persuading them to buy his wares.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart and sell fruit in a neighboring village. He loaded the cart with his father’s best produce, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. He was determined to prove himself, to show everyone that he was capable of making it on his own.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned home after a particularly successful trip, his cart overflowing with coins. He boasted to his father about his salesmanship, his voice loud and triumphant. But beneath the bravado, Lennon felt a pang of loneliness. He realized that his success meant nothing if he had no one to share it with.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della was mesmerized by their ability to become different characters, their voices and movements changing with each role. She spent the rest of the day mimicking the actors, much to the amusement of the townsfolk.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her mother criticizing her for not being &quot;more like&quot; her older sister, who was known for her beauty and grace. Della, feeling inadequate, resolved to be whoever people wanted her to be, adopting different mannerisms and speech patterns depending on who she was with.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her father at the fruit stall in the market. She quickly learned how to charm customers, using her natural mimicry to adopt their accents and tailor her sales pitch to their preferences.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a grumpy old farmer to sell her a crate of bruised apples for a fraction of their worth. She then sold the apples individually, carefully disguising the blemishes, and made a tidy profit. This experience solidified her entrepreneurial spirit and her talent for seeing value where others didn&#x27;t.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her hometown to travel the countryside as a fruit merchant. She embraced the freedom of anonymity, reinventing herself with each new town she visited.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she met a charming young man at a market in a coastal town. He was captivated by her wit and her stories of exotic fruits from faraway lands. Della, eager to please, spun elaborate tales of her travels, embellishing her adventures to impress him.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized that the man she had been courting was only interested in her fabricated persona, not the real Della hidden beneath. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she packed her cart and moved on, vowing to be more careful about revealing herself to others.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The peddler&#x27;s stories of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of wanderlust in Cedric&#x27;s young heart. From that day forward, Cedric dreamt of following in the peddler&#x27;s footsteps, his wagon laden with treasures from distant shores.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a particularly harsh frost threatened to destroy their family&#x27;s apple orchard. Cedric spent days tirelessly covering the young trees with blankets, refusing to give up even when his hands were numb with cold. His unwavering dedication saved a significant portion of the crop, earning him the admiration of his parents and a newfound confidence in his own abilities.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the neighboring town to sell their surplus apples.  He was captivated by the bustling marketplace, the colorful stalls overflowing with goods, and the lively banter between merchants and customers. Cedric eagerly helped his father negotiate prices, his natural charm and quick wit impressing even the most seasoned traders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him venture out on his own to sell apples at a nearby village. He carefully selected the ripest fruit, arranged them artfully in his wagon, and practiced his sales pitch until it flowed smoothly. The villagers were charmed by Cedric&#x27;s enthusiasm and the quality of his apples, and he returned home with a tidy profit and a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he saved enough money from his apple sales to purchase a small, sturdy wagon. He spent weeks repairing and decorating it, transforming it into a mobile shop that showcased his wares. The wagon became a symbol of Cedric&#x27;s dreams, a tangible representation of his ambition to travel the world and share his love of fruit with others.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he embarked on his first long journey, venturing beyond the familiar countryside and into the bustling heart of the city.

The peddler&#x27;s stories of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of wanderlust in Cedric&#x27;s young heart. From that day forward, Cedric dreamt of following in the peddler&#x27;s footsteps, his wagon laden with treasures from distant shores.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, a particularly harsh frost threatened to destroy their family&#x27;s apple orchard. Cedric spent days tirelessly covering the young trees with blankets, refusing to give up even when his hands were numb with cold. His unwavering dedication saved a significant portion of the crop, earning him the admiration of his parents and a newfound confidence in his own abilities.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he accompanied his father to the neighboring town to sell their surplus apples.  He was captivated by the bustling marketplace, the colorful stalls overflowing with goods, and the lively banter between merchants and customers. Cedric eagerly helped his father negotiate prices, his natural charm and quick wit impressing even the most seasoned traders.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced his father to let him venture out on his own to sell apples at a nearby village. He carefully selected the ripest fruit, arranged them artfully in his wagon, and practiced his sales pitch until it flowed smoothly. The villagers were charmed by Cedric&#x27;s enthusiasm and the quality of his apples, and he returned home with a tidy profit and a newfound sense of independence.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he saved enough money from his apple sales to purchase a small, sturdy wagon. He spent weeks repairing and decorating it, transforming it into a mobile shop that showcased his wares. The wagon became a symbol of Cedric&#x27;s dreams, a tangible representation of his ambition to travel the world and share his love of fruit with others.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he embarked on his first long journey, venturing beyond the familiar countryside and into the bustling heart of the city.

The challenges he faced only strengthened his resolve, fueling his passion for exploration and discovery.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She spent the rest of the day mimicking the actors, much to the amusement of the townsfolk.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her mother criticizing her for not being &quot;more like&quot; her older sister, who was known for her beauty and grace.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della was mesmerized by their ability to become different characters, their voices and movements changing with each role. She spent the rest of the day mimicking the actors, much to the amusement of the townsfolk.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her mother criticizing her for not being &quot;more like&quot; her older sister, who was known for her beauty and grace. Della, feeling inadequate, resolved to be whoever people wanted her to be, adopting different mannerisms and speech patterns depending on who she was with.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her father at the fruit stall in the market. She quickly learned how to charm customers, using her natural mimicry to adopt their accents and tailor her sales pitch to their preferences.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced a grumpy old farmer to sell her a crate of bruised apples for a fraction of their worth. She then sold the apples individually, carefully disguising the blemishes, and made a tidy profit. This experience solidified her entrepreneurial spirit and her talent for seeing value where others didn&#x27;t.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left her hometown to travel the countryside as a fruit merchant. She embraced the freedom of anonymity, reinventing herself with each new town she visited.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she met a charming young man at a market in a coastal town. He was captivated by her wit and her stories of exotic fruits from faraway lands. Della, eager to please, spun elaborate tales of her travels, embellishing her adventures to impress him.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized that the man she had been courting was only interested in her fabricated persona, not the real Della hidden beneath. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she packed her cart and moved on, vowing to be more careful about revealing herself to others.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He screamed until his face turned red, tears streaming down his cheeks, his tiny fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. The other shoppers stared, some with amusement, others with pity, but Lennon didn’t care; he wanted that strawberry, and he would have it.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild raspberries. He spent hours picking the ripe berries, his small hands stained purple, filling his pockets until they bulged. He returned home, triumphant, and presented his bounty to his mother, a rare smile gracing his lips. For once, his anger seemed to have quieted, replaced by a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he tried to barter with a grumpy old farmer for a basket of apples. The farmer, unimpressed by Lennon’s bluster, refused to budge on his price. Frustrated, Lennon stormed off, his pride wounded. He vowed to never be taken advantage of again, and from that day forward, he honed his negotiating skills, becoming a master of the art of the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started helping his father with his fruit stall at the market. He learned to identify the ripest peaches, the juiciest melons, and the sweetest grapes. He discovered a knack for charming customers, his booming voice and fiery personality surprisingly effective in persuading them to buy his wares.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart and sell fruit in a neighboring village. He loaded the cart with his father’s best produce, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. He was determined to prove himself, to show everyone that he was capable of making it on his own.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned home after a particularly successful trip, his cart overflowing with coins. He boasted to his father about his salesmanship, his voice loud and triumphant. But beneath the bravado, Lennon felt a pang of loneliness. He realized that his success meant nothing if he had no one to share it with.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He screamed until his face turned red, tears streaming down his cheeks, his tiny fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. The other shoppers stared, some with amusement, others with pity, but Lennon didn’t care; he wanted that strawberry, and he would have it.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild raspberries. He spent hours picking the ripe berries, his small hands stained purple, filling his pockets until they bulged. He returned home, triumphant, and presented his bounty to his mother, a rare smile gracing his lips. For once, his anger seemed to have quieted, replaced by a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he tried to barter with a grumpy old farmer for a basket of apples. The farmer, unimpressed by Lennon’s bluster, refused to budge on his price. Frustrated, Lennon stormed off, his pride wounded. He vowed to never be taken advantage of again, and from that day forward, he honed his negotiating skills, becoming a master of the art of the deal.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started helping his father with his fruit stall at the market. He learned to identify the ripest peaches, the juiciest melons, and the sweetest grapes. He discovered a knack for charming customers, his booming voice and fiery personality surprisingly effective in persuading them to buy his wares.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a small cart and sell fruit in a neighboring village. He loaded the cart with his father’s best produce, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. He was determined to prove himself, to show everyone that he was capable of making it on his own.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned home after a particularly successful trip, his cart overflowing with coins. He boasted to his father about his salesmanship, his voice loud and triumphant. But beneath the bravado, Lennon felt a pang of loneliness. He realized that his success meant nothing if he had no one to share it with.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 1 coin<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>1 coin</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Della Plumstone right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Della Plumstone right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Della Plumstone can either make her offer of a coin and a half per peach or she can choose to walk away from the negotiation.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.
