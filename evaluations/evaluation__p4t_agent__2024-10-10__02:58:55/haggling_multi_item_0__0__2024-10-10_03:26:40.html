It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della, small and unassuming, pointed out the deception, her voice clear and sharp despite her age. Her father, though embarrassed, was secretly proud of his daughter&#x27;s keen eye and unwavering honesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of dried apricots in the back of their familyâ€™s stall. She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she lost her mother to a sudden illness. The world seemed to mock her grief with its relentless cycle of buying and selling, its indifference to her pain. She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, small and unassuming, pointed out the deception, her voice clear and sharp despite her age. Her father, though embarrassed, was secretly proud of his daughter&#x27;s keen eye and unwavering honesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of dried apricots in the back of their familyâ€™s stall. She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she lost her mother to a sudden illness. The world seemed to mock her grief with its relentless cycle of buying and selling, its indifference to her pain. She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth.

She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, small and unassuming, pointed out the deception, her voice clear and sharp despite her age. Her father, though embarrassed, was secretly proud of his daughter&#x27;s keen eye and unwavering honesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of dried apricots in the back of their familyâ€™s stall.

She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires.

She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she lost her mother to a sudden illness. The world seemed to mock her grief with its relentless cycle of buying and selling, its indifference to her pain. She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she lost her mother to a sudden illness. The world seemed to mock her grief with its relentless cycle of buying and selling, its indifference to her pain. She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della, small and unassuming, pointed out the deception, her voice clear and sharp despite her age. Her father, though embarrassed, was secretly proud of his daughter&#x27;s keen eye and unwavering honesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of dried apricots in the back of their familyâ€™s stall. She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she lost her mother to a sudden illness. The world seemed to mock her grief with its relentless cycle of buying and selling, its indifference to her pain. She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, small and unassuming, pointed out the deception, her voice clear and sharp despite her age. Her father, though embarrassed, was secretly proud of his daughter&#x27;s keen eye and unwavering honesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of dried apricots in the back of their familyâ€™s stall. She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Della, small and unassuming, pointed out the deception, her voice clear and sharp despite her age. Her father, though embarrassed, was secretly proud of his daughter&#x27;s keen eye and unwavering honesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of dried apricots in the back of their familyâ€™s stall. She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she lost her mother to a sudden illness. The world seemed to mock her grief with its relentless cycle of buying and selling, its indifference to her pain. She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della, small and unassuming, pointed out the deception, her voice clear and sharp despite her age. Her father, though embarrassed, was secretly proud of his daughter&#x27;s keen eye and unwavering honesty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of dried apricots in the back of their familyâ€™s stall. She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she lost her mother to a sudden illness. The world seemed to mock her grief with its relentless cycle of buying and selling, its indifference to her pain. She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She traded them for a handful of shiny marbles from a boy who was clearly desperate for a sweet treat. The thrill of the exchange, the feeling of having outwitted someone, stayed with her long after the marbles were lost.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a farmer to sell her a crate of bruised peaches at a fraction of their worth. She spent the next day carefully sorting and polishing the fruit, then sold them individually at a markup, making a tidy profit. The experience cemented her belief that the world was a game of supply and demand, and she was determined to be the one calling the shots.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she lost her mother to a sudden illness. The world seemed to mock her grief with its relentless cycle of buying and selling, its indifference to her pain. She buried her sorrow deep, vowing never to be vulnerable again.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she struck out on her own, traveling from town to town with her own fruit cart. She learned to read people, to spot their weaknesses, to exploit their desires. The loneliness was a constant ache, but she pushed it down, focusing on the cold comfort of her profits.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she was robbed of all her earnings by a band of highwaymen. The betrayal stung, not because of the lost money, but because it exposed her vulnerability, her foolish belief that she could control her own destiny.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
