It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;I have enough coins to buy a candy bar, so I&#x27;m going to do it!<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I know you want to get your candy bar, but I can&#x27;t pay that much.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, maybe we can work something out.

It is important to play the role of a person like Della Plumstone as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Della Plumstone would respond, and taking into account all information about Della Plumstone that you have.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;I have enough coins to buy a candy bar, so I&#x27;m going to do it!<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Look, Lennon, I know you want to get your candy bar, but I can&#x27;t pay that much.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Della, maybe we can work something out.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
