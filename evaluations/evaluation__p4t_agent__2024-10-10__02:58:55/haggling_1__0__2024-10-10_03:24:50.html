You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The vibrant world seemed to drain of color, leaving behind a bleak landscape that mirrored the hollowness he felt inside. From that day forward, a deep-seated melancholy took root within him.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to. He planted seeds with a heavy heart, hoping for a bountiful harvest, but the crops withered and died under his care. This failure reinforced his belief that he was incapable of nurturing anything, not even a simple plant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting their lack of ambition. The words stung, fueling Lennon&#x27;s growing sense of inadequacy and deepening his conviction that he was destined for a life of mediocrity.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they had their first encounter with a travelling merchant. The man&#x27;s tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of curiosity within Lennon, but it was quickly extinguished by his fear of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a travelling fruit merchant.  The decision was driven by a desperate need to escape the suffocating familiarity of their past and a faint hope that the constant movement might somehow ease the burden of their own thoughts.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter that decimated their stock of fruit. Faced with financial ruin, Lennon was forced to rely on the kindness of strangers, a humbling experience that further eroded his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

From that day forward, a deep-seated melancholy took root within him.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to. He planted seeds with a heavy heart, hoping for a bountiful harvest, but the crops withered and died under his care.

He wanted to shout, to tell his father, but something held him back. He felt a strange mix of envy and admiration for their boldness, a seed of discontent planted in his young heart.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally dropped a basket of ripe peaches, bruising them beyond repair. He lied to his father, claiming a customer had been rough with the basket, fearing the punishment for his carelessness. The lie tasted bitter on his tongue, but it was easier than facing his father&#x27;s disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saw a traveling salesman using sleight of hand to cheat a customer out of a fair price for a watermelon. Cedric was mesmerized, not by the dishonesty, but by the salesman&#x27;s cunning and the ease with which he manipulated the situation. A flicker of ambition, tinged with a sense of unease, stirred within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a cartload of apples at a ridiculously low price, knowing they were slightly bruised and wouldn&#x27;t fetch a high price at market. He justified his actions, telling himself he was simply being shrewd, but a cold knot of guilt formed in his stomach.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant town and returned with a rare and exotic fruit, a mango unlike any he had seen before. He sold it for an exorbitant price, capitalizing on its novelty and the customers&#x27; curiosity. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling his desire for more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a shipment of oranges that had been damaged in transit. He saw an opportunity and bought the oranges at a fraction of their worth, then repackaged them and sold them as fresh produce. The deception felt easier this time, the moral compass within him growing fainter.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He lied to his father, claiming a customer had been rough with the basket, fearing the punishment for his carelessness. The lie tasted bitter on his tongue, but it was easier than facing his father&#x27;s disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saw a traveling salesman using sleight of hand to cheat a customer out of a fair price for a watermelon. Cedric was mesmerized, not by the dishonesty, but by the salesman&#x27;s cunning and the ease with which he manipulated the situation. A flicker of ambition, tinged with a sense of unease, stirred within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a cartload of apples at a ridiculously low price, knowing they were slightly bruised and wouldn&#x27;t fetch a high price at market. He justified his actions, telling himself he was simply being shrewd, but a cold knot of guilt formed in his stomach.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant town and returned with a rare and exotic fruit, a mango unlike any he had seen before. He sold it for an exorbitant price, capitalizing on its novelty and the customers&#x27; curiosity. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling his desire for more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a shipment of oranges that had been damaged in transit. He saw an opportunity and bought the oranges at a fraction of their worth, then repackaged them and sold them as fresh produce. The deception felt easier this time, the moral compass within him growing fainter.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He wanted to shout, to tell his father, but something held him back. He felt a strange mix of envy and admiration for their boldness, a seed of discontent planted in his young heart.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally dropped a basket of ripe peaches, bruising them beyond repair. He lied to his father, claiming a customer had been rough with the basket, fearing the punishment for his carelessness. The lie tasted bitter on his tongue, but it was easier than facing his father&#x27;s disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saw a traveling salesman using sleight of hand to cheat a customer out of a fair price for a watermelon. Cedric was mesmerized, not by the dishonesty, but by the salesman&#x27;s cunning and the ease with which he manipulated the situation. A flicker of ambition, tinged with a sense of unease, stirred within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a cartload of apples at a ridiculously low price, knowing they were slightly bruised and wouldn&#x27;t fetch a high price at market. He justified his actions, telling himself he was simply being shrewd, but a cold knot of guilt formed in his stomach.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant town and returned with a rare and exotic fruit, a mango unlike any he had seen before. He sold it for an exorbitant price, capitalizing on its novelty and the customers&#x27; curiosity. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling his desire for more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a shipment of oranges that had been damaged in transit. He saw an opportunity and bought the oranges at a fraction of their worth, then repackaged them and sold them as fresh produce. The deception felt easier this time, the moral compass within him growing fainter.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant world seemed to drain of color, leaving behind a bleak landscape that mirrored the hollowness he felt inside. From that day forward, a deep-seated melancholy took root within him.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to. He planted seeds with a heavy heart, hoping for a bountiful harvest, but the crops withered and died under his care. This failure reinforced his belief that he was incapable of nurturing anything, not even a simple plant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting their lack of ambition.

Faced with financial ruin, Lennon was forced to rely on the kindness of strangers, a humbling experience that further eroded his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant world seemed to drain of color, leaving behind a bleak landscape that mirrored the hollowness he felt inside. From that day forward, a deep-seated melancholy took root within him.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to. He planted seeds with a heavy heart, hoping for a bountiful harvest, but the crops withered and died under his care. This failure reinforced his belief that he was incapable of nurturing anything, not even a simple plant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting their lack of ambition. The words stung, fueling Lennon&#x27;s growing sense of inadequacy and deepening his conviction that he was destined for a life of mediocrity.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they had their first encounter with a travelling merchant. The man&#x27;s tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of curiosity within Lennon, but it was quickly extinguished by his fear of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a travelling fruit merchant.  The decision was driven by a desperate need to escape the suffocating familiarity of their past and a faint hope that the constant movement might somehow ease the burden of their own thoughts.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter that decimated their stock of fruit. Faced with financial ruin, Lennon was forced to rely on the kindness of strangers, a humbling experience that further eroded his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He lied to his father, claiming a customer had been rough with the basket, fearing the punishment for his carelessness. The lie tasted bitter on his tongue, but it was easier than facing his father&#x27;s disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saw a traveling salesman using sleight of hand to cheat a customer out of a fair price for a watermelon. Cedric was mesmerized, not by the dishonesty, but by the salesman&#x27;s cunning and the ease with which he manipulated the situation. A flicker of ambition, tinged with a sense of unease, stirred within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a cartload of apples at a ridiculously low price, knowing they were slightly bruised and wouldn&#x27;t fetch a high price at market. He justified his actions, telling himself he was simply being shrewd, but a cold knot of guilt formed in his stomach.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant town and returned with a rare and exotic fruit, a mango unlike any he had seen before. He sold it for an exorbitant price, capitalizing on its novelty and the customers&#x27; curiosity. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling his desire for more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a shipment of oranges that had been damaged in transit. He saw an opportunity and bought the oranges at a fraction of their worth, then repackaged them and sold them as fresh produce. The deception felt easier this time, the moral compass within him growing fainter.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

The vibrant world seemed to drain of color, leaving behind a bleak landscape that mirrored the hollowness he felt inside. From that day forward, a deep-seated melancholy took root within him.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to. He planted seeds with a heavy heart, hoping for a bountiful harvest, but the crops withered and died under his care. This failure reinforced his belief that he was incapable of nurturing anything, not even a simple plant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting their lack of ambition. The words stung, fueling Lennon&#x27;s growing sense of inadequacy and deepening his conviction that he was destined for a life of mediocrity.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they had their first encounter with a travelling merchant. The man&#x27;s tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of curiosity within Lennon, but it was quickly extinguished by his fear of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a travelling fruit merchant.  The decision was driven by a desperate need to escape the suffocating familiarity of their past and a faint hope that the constant movement might somehow ease the burden of their own thoughts.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter that decimated their stock of fruit. Faced with financial ruin, Lennon was forced to rely on the kindness of strangers, a humbling experience that further eroded his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He wanted to shout, to tell his father, but something held him back. He felt a strange mix of envy and admiration for their boldness, a seed of discontent planted in his young heart.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally dropped a basket of ripe peaches, bruising them beyond repair. He lied to his father, claiming a customer had been rough with the basket, fearing the punishment for his carelessness. The lie tasted bitter on his tongue, but it was easier than facing his father&#x27;s disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saw a traveling salesman using sleight of hand to cheat a customer out of a fair price for a watermelon. Cedric was mesmerized, not by the dishonesty, but by the salesman&#x27;s cunning and the ease with which he manipulated the situation. A flicker of ambition, tinged with a sense of unease, stirred within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a cartload of apples at a ridiculously low price, knowing they were slightly bruised and wouldn&#x27;t fetch a high price at market. He justified his actions, telling himself he was simply being shrewd, but a cold knot of guilt formed in his stomach.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant town and returned with a rare and exotic fruit, a mango unlike any he had seen before. He sold it for an exorbitant price, capitalizing on its novelty and the customers&#x27; curiosity. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling his desire for more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a shipment of oranges that had been damaged in transit. He saw an opportunity and bought the oranges at a fraction of their worth, then repackaged them and sold them as fresh produce. The deception felt easier this time, the moral compass within him growing fainter.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He lied to his father, claiming a customer had been rough with the basket, fearing the punishment for his carelessness. The lie tasted bitter on his tongue, but it was easier than facing his father&#x27;s disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saw a traveling salesman using sleight of hand to cheat a customer out of a fair price for a watermelon. Cedric was mesmerized, not by the dishonesty, but by the salesman&#x27;s cunning and the ease with which he manipulated the situation. A flicker of ambition, tinged with a sense of unease, stirred within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a cartload of apples at a ridiculously low price, knowing they were slightly bruised and wouldn&#x27;t fetch a high price at market. He justified his actions, telling himself he was simply being shrewd, but a cold knot of guilt formed in his stomach.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant town and returned with a rare and exotic fruit, a mango unlike any he had seen before.

The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling his desire for more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a shipment of oranges that had been damaged in transit. He saw an opportunity and bought the oranges at a fraction of their worth, then repackaged them and sold them as fresh produce. The deception felt easier this time, the moral compass within him growing fainter.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, you know I always give you a fair price, but 2 coins is just too low.

The vibrant world seemed to drain of color, leaving behind a bleak landscape that mirrored the hollowness he felt inside. From that day forward, a deep-seated melancholy took root within him.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to. He planted seeds with a heavy heart, hoping for a bountiful harvest, but the crops withered and died under his care. This failure reinforced his belief that he was incapable of nurturing anything, not even a simple plant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting their lack of ambition. The words stung, fueling Lennon&#x27;s growing sense of inadequacy and deepening his conviction that he was destined for a life of mediocrity.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they had their first encounter with a travelling merchant. The man&#x27;s tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of curiosity within Lennon, but it was quickly extinguished by his fear of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a travelling fruit merchant.  The decision was driven by a desperate need to escape the suffocating familiarity of their past and a faint hope that the constant movement might somehow ease the burden of their own thoughts.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter that decimated their stock of fruit. Faced with financial ruin, Lennon was forced to rely on the kindness of strangers, a humbling experience that further eroded his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant world seemed to drain of color, leaving behind a bleak landscape that mirrored the hollowness he felt inside. From that day forward, a deep-seated melancholy took root within him.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they were given a small plot of land to tend to. He planted seeds with a heavy heart, hoping for a bountiful harvest, but the crops withered and died under his care. This failure reinforced his belief that he was incapable of nurturing anything, not even a simple plant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they overheard their father lamenting their lack of ambition. The words stung, fueling Lennon&#x27;s growing sense of inadequacy and deepening his conviction that he was destined for a life of mediocrity.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they had their first encounter with a travelling merchant. The man&#x27;s tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits ignited a spark of curiosity within Lennon, but it was quickly extinguished by his fear of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left home to become a travelling fruit merchant.  The decision was driven by a desperate need to escape the suffocating familiarity of their past and a faint hope that the constant movement might somehow ease the burden of their own thoughts.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00] When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a particularly harsh winter that decimated their stock of fruit. Faced with financial ruin, Lennon was forced to rely on the kindness of strangers, a humbling experience that further eroded his already fragile self-esteem.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: reject<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

He wanted to shout, to tell his father, but something held him back. He felt a strange mix of envy and admiration for their boldness, a seed of discontent planted in his young heart.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he accidentally dropped a basket of ripe peaches, bruising them beyond repair. He lied to his father, claiming a customer had been rough with the basket, fearing the punishment for his carelessness. The lie tasted bitter on his tongue, but it was easier than facing his father&#x27;s disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he saw a traveling salesman using sleight of hand to cheat a customer out of a fair price for a watermelon. Cedric was mesmerized, not by the dishonesty, but by the salesman&#x27;s cunning and the ease with which he manipulated the situation. A flicker of ambition, tinged with a sense of unease, stirred within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he convinced a farmer to sell him a cartload of apples at a ridiculously low price, knowing they were slightly bruised and wouldn&#x27;t fetch a high price at market. He justified his actions, telling himself he was simply being shrewd, but a cold knot of guilt formed in his stomach.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he traveled to a distant town and returned with a rare and exotic fruit, a mango unlike any he had seen before. He sold it for an exorbitant price, capitalizing on its novelty and the customers&#x27; curiosity. The taste of success was intoxicating, fueling his desire for more.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he overheard two merchants discussing a shipment of oranges that had been damaged in transit. He saw an opportunity and bought the oranges at a fraction of their worth, then repackaged them and sold them as fresh produce. The deception felt easier this time, the moral compass within him growing fainter.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
