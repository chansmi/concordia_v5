It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, I know these apples are fine, but wouldn&#x27;t you say 4 coins is a fair price?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, I know these apples are fine, but wouldn&#x27;t you say 4 coins is a fair price?</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

The customer, a gruff woman with sharp eyes, tried to drive down the price of a basket of peaches, but Lennon’s father stood firm, his voice calm but unwavering. Lennon was mesmerized by the back-and-forth, the way words could be weapons and shields, and a seed of ambition began to grow within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, they snuck into the orchard at the edge of town and stole a handful of plump, ruby-red cherries. The cherries were forbidden fruit, reserved for the wealthy landowner who owned the orchard, but Lennon couldn’t resist their sweet allure. The taste was intoxicating, but the guilt that followed was even stronger, a bitter aftertaste that lingered long after the last cherry was gone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, they helped their father load their wagon with baskets of figs for a long journey to a distant market town. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but also nervous about leaving the familiar comforts of home. As they traveled through rolling hills and bustling villages, Lennon began to see the world beyond their small town, and a thirst for something more took root in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, they convinced a farmer to sell them a wagonload of bruised and misshapen apples for a pittance. The farmer was desperate to get rid of the fruit, and Lennon saw an opportunity to make a quick profit. They sold the apples in the next town for double the price, their heart pounding with a mixture of guilt and exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, they struck out on their own, leaving their father’s business to start their own fruit trading venture. They were filled with a heady sense of freedom and ambition, but also a nagging doubt about whether they were truly ready for the challenges ahead.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, they met a beautiful tavern singer in a dusty frontier town. She had fiery red hair and a voice that could melt the coldest heart, and Lennon was instantly smitten. They spent their days exploring the town and their nights lost in each other’s arms, but their happiness was short-lived.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal. This newfound skill allowed Della to expand their business, acquiring rare and exotic fruits from far-off lands.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal. This newfound skill allowed Della to expand their business, acquiring rare and exotic fruits from far-off lands.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal. This newfound skill allowed Della to expand their business, acquiring rare and exotic fruits from far-off lands.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a gruff woman with sharp eyes, tried to drive down the price of a basket of peaches, but Lennon’s father stood firm, his voice calm but unwavering. Lennon was mesmerized by the back-and-forth, the way words could be weapons and shields, and a seed of ambition began to grow within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, they snuck into the orchard at the edge of town and stole a handful of plump, ruby-red cherries. The cherries were forbidden fruit, reserved for the wealthy landowner who owned the orchard, but Lennon couldn’t resist their sweet allure. The taste was intoxicating, but the guilt that followed was even stronger, a bitter aftertaste that lingered long after the last cherry was gone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, they helped their father load their wagon with baskets of figs for a long journey to a distant market town. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but also nervous about leaving the familiar comforts of home. As they traveled through rolling hills and bustling villages, Lennon began to see the world beyond their small town, and a thirst for something more took root in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, they convinced a farmer to sell them a wagonload of bruised and misshapen apples for a pittance. The farmer was desperate to get rid of the fruit, and Lennon saw an opportunity to make a quick profit. They sold the apples in the next town for double the price, their heart pounding with a mixture of guilt and exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, they struck out on their own, leaving their father’s business to start their own fruit trading venture. They were filled with a heady sense of freedom and ambition, but also a nagging doubt about whether they were truly ready for the challenges ahead.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, they met a beautiful tavern singer in a dusty frontier town. She had fiery red hair and a voice that could melt the coldest heart, and Lennon was instantly smitten. They spent their days exploring the town and their nights lost in each other’s arms, but their happiness was short-lived.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The customer, a gruff woman with sharp eyes, tried to drive down the price of a basket of peaches, but Lennon’s father stood firm, his voice calm but unwavering. Lennon was mesmerized by the back-and-forth, the way words could be weapons and shields, and a seed of ambition began to grow within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, they snuck into the orchard at the edge of town and stole a handful of plump, ruby-red cherries. The cherries were forbidden fruit, reserved for the wealthy landowner who owned the orchard, but Lennon couldn’t resist their sweet allure. The taste was intoxicating, but the guilt that followed was even stronger, a bitter aftertaste that lingered long after the last cherry was gone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, they helped their father load their wagon with baskets of figs for a long journey to a distant market town. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but also nervous about leaving the familiar comforts of home. As they traveled through rolling hills and bustling villages, Lennon began to see the world beyond their small town, and a thirst for something more took root in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, they convinced a farmer to sell them a wagonload of bruised and misshapen apples for a pittance. The farmer was desperate to get rid of the fruit, and Lennon saw an opportunity to make a quick profit. They sold the apples in the next town for double the price, their heart pounding with a mixture of guilt and exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, they struck out on their own, leaving their father’s business to start their own fruit trading venture. They were filled with a heady sense of freedom and ambition, but also a nagging doubt about whether they were truly ready for the challenges ahead.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, they met a beautiful tavern singer in a dusty frontier town. She had fiery red hair and a voice that could melt the coldest heart, and Lennon was instantly smitten. They spent their days exploring the town and their nights lost in each other’s arms, but their happiness was short-lived.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, however, saw the apple as something to be possessed, not shared. He snuck into the barn later that day and took Thomas&#x27;s best apple, hiding it under his bed, feeling a strange thrill at the act of taking.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, abandoned bird’s nest in the barn. He carefully collected the delicate twigs and feathers, marveling at their intricate construction. He then traded them to the miller’s son for a handful of shiny pebbles, feeling a surge of satisfaction at the successful exchange.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries from the forest, promising them a share of the profits. He then sold the berries at the market, keeping all the money for himself, rationalizing that he had done the most work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working at the local market, helping his father sell their meager harvest of apples. He quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and maximizing profits, even if it meant shortchanging customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their apples, promising a higher price. He returned with empty baskets and a pocket full of coins, having traded the apples for trinkets and baubles, convinced they would fetch a higher price back home.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he struck a deal with a local farmer to buy his entire crop of peaches at a low price, knowing that a drought was coming. He then sold the peaches at an inflated price when the drought hit, feeling no remorse for profiting from others&#x27; misfortune.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, however, saw the apple as something to be possessed, not shared. He snuck into the barn later that day and took Thomas&#x27;s best apple, hiding it under his bed, feeling a strange thrill at the act of taking.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries from the forest, promising them a share of the profits. He then sold the berries at the market, keeping all the money for himself, rationalizing that he had done the most work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working at the local market, helping his father sell their meager harvest of apples. He quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and maximizing profits, even if it meant shortchanging customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their apples, promising a higher price. He returned with empty baskets and a pocket full of coins, having traded the apples for trinkets and baubles, convinced they would fetch a higher price back home.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he struck a deal with a local farmer to buy his entire crop of peaches at a low price, knowing that a drought was coming. He then sold the peaches at an inflated price when the drought hit, feeling no remorse for profiting from others&#x27; misfortune.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home.

Cedric, however, saw the apple as something to be possessed, not shared. He snuck into the barn later that day and took Thomas&#x27;s best apple, hiding it under his bed, feeling a strange thrill at the act of taking.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, abandoned bird’s nest in the barn. He carefully collected the delicate twigs and feathers, marveling at their intricate construction. He then traded them to the miller’s son for a handful of shiny pebbles, feeling a surge of satisfaction at the successful exchange.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries from the forest, promising them a share of the profits. He then sold the berries at the market, keeping all the money for himself, rationalizing that he had done the most work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working at the local market, helping his father sell their meager harvest of apples. He quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and maximizing profits, even if it meant shortchanging customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their apples, promising a higher price. He returned with empty baskets and a pocket full of coins, having traded the apples for trinkets and baubles, convinced they would fetch a higher price back home.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he struck a deal with a local farmer to buy his entire crop of peaches at a low price, knowing that a drought was coming. He then sold the peaches at an inflated price when the drought hit, feeling no remorse for profiting from others&#x27; misfortune.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, however, saw the apple as something to be possessed, not shared. He snuck into the barn later that day and took Thomas&#x27;s best apple, hiding it under his bed, feeling a strange thrill at the act of taking.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, abandoned bird’s nest in the barn. He carefully collected the delicate twigs and feathers, marveling at their intricate construction. He then traded them to the miller’s son for a handful of shiny pebbles, feeling a surge of satisfaction at the successful exchange.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries from the forest, promising them a share of the profits. He then sold the berries at the market, keeping all the money for himself, rationalizing that he had done the most work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working at the local market, helping his father sell their meager harvest of apples. He quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and maximizing profits, even if it meant shortchanging customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their apples, promising a higher price. He returned with empty baskets and a pocket full of coins, having traded the apples for trinkets and baubles, convinced they would fetch a higher price back home.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he struck a deal with a local farmer to buy his entire crop of peaches at a low price, knowing that a drought was coming. He then sold the peaches at an inflated price when the drought hit, feeling no remorse for profiting from others&#x27; misfortune.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but also nervous about leaving the familiar comforts of home.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home.

They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, I know these apples are fine, but wouldn&#x27;t you say 4 coins is a fair price?<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, you know I value your fruit, but 4 coins is a bit steep for me.

But I understand your concern about the price. Perhaps we can work something out.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Della, these pears look lovely, but I&#x27;m not sure my customers would pay my asking price if I had to charge them what you&#x27;re asking.<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, how about we meet in the middle?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

The customer, a gruff woman with sharp eyes, tried to drive down the price of a basket of peaches, but Lennon’s father stood firm, his voice calm but unwavering. Lennon was mesmerized by the back-and-forth, the way words could be weapons and shields, and a seed of ambition began to grow within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, they snuck into the orchard at the edge of town and stole a handful of plump, ruby-red cherries. The cherries were forbidden fruit, reserved for the wealthy landowner who owned the orchard, but Lennon couldn’t resist their sweet allure. The taste was intoxicating, but the guilt that followed was even stronger, a bitter aftertaste that lingered long after the last cherry was gone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, they helped their father load their wagon with baskets of figs for a long journey to a distant market town. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but also nervous about leaving the familiar comforts of home. As they traveled through rolling hills and bustling villages, Lennon began to see the world beyond their small town, and a thirst for something more took root in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, they convinced a farmer to sell them a wagonload of bruised and misshapen apples for a pittance. The farmer was desperate to get rid of the fruit, and Lennon saw an opportunity to make a quick profit. They sold the apples in the next town for double the price, their heart pounding with a mixture of guilt and exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, they struck out on their own, leaving their father’s business to start their own fruit trading venture. They were filled with a heady sense of freedom and ambition, but also a nagging doubt about whether they were truly ready for the challenges ahead.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, they met a beautiful tavern singer in a dusty frontier town. She had fiery red hair and a voice that could melt the coldest heart, and Lennon was instantly smitten. They spent their days exploring the town and their nights lost in each other’s arms, but their happiness was short-lived.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal. This newfound skill allowed Della to expand their business, acquiring rare and exotic fruits from far-off lands.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal. This newfound skill allowed Della to expand their business, acquiring rare and exotic fruits from far-off lands.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric, however, saw the apple as something to be possessed, not shared. He snuck into the barn later that day and took Thomas&#x27;s best apple, hiding it under his bed, feeling a strange thrill at the act of taking.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, abandoned bird’s nest in the barn. He carefully collected the delicate twigs and feathers, marveling at their intricate construction. He then traded them to the miller’s son for a handful of shiny pebbles, feeling a surge of satisfaction at the successful exchange.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries from the forest, promising them a share of the profits. He then sold the berries at the market, keeping all the money for himself, rationalizing that he had done the most work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working at the local market, helping his father sell their meager harvest of apples. He quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and maximizing profits, even if it meant shortchanging customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their apples, promising a higher price. He returned with empty baskets and a pocket full of coins, having traded the apples for trinkets and baubles, convinced they would fetch a higher price back home.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he struck a deal with a local farmer to buy his entire crop of peaches at a low price, knowing that a drought was coming.

He snuck into the barn later that day and took Thomas&#x27;s best apple, hiding it under his bed, feeling a strange thrill at the act of taking.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, abandoned bird’s nest in the barn. He carefully collected the delicate twigs and feathers, marveling at their intricate construction. He then traded them to the miller’s son for a handful of shiny pebbles, feeling a surge of satisfaction at the successful exchange.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced a group of younger children to help him gather berries from the forest, promising them a share of the profits. He then sold the berries at the market, keeping all the money for himself, rationalizing that he had done the most work.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he began working at the local market, helping his father sell their meager harvest of apples. He quickly learned the art of haggling, driving hard bargains and maximizing profits, even if it meant shortchanging customers.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him travel to a neighboring town to sell their apples, promising a higher price. He returned with empty baskets and a pocket full of coins, having traded the apples for trinkets and baubles, convinced they would fetch a higher price back home.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he struck a deal with a local farmer to buy his entire crop of peaches at a low price, knowing that a drought was coming. He then sold the peaches at an inflated price when the drought hit, feeling no remorse for profiting from others&#x27; misfortune.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal. This newfound skill allowed Della to expand their business, acquiring rare and exotic fruits from far-off lands.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home.

Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but also nervous about leaving the familiar comforts of home. As they traveled through rolling hills and bustling villages, Lennon began to see the world beyond their small town, and a thirst for something more took root in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, they convinced a farmer to sell them a wagonload of bruised and misshapen apples for a pittance.

They sold the apples in the next town for double the price, their heart pounding with a mixture of guilt and exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, they struck out on their own, leaving their father’s business to start their own fruit trading venture. They were filled with a heady sense of freedom and ambition, but also a nagging doubt about whether they were truly ready for the challenges ahead.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, I know these apples are fine, but wouldn&#x27;t you say 4 coins is a fair price?<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Lennon, you know I value your fruit, but 4 coins is a bit steep for me.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal.

The berries were tiny and perfectly ripe, bursting with a sweetness unlike anything Della had ever tasted. Della carefully gathered a basketful, arranging them in a spiral pattern, marveling at their vibrant red color against the green leaves.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard their father lamenting the poor quality of apples at the market. The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair.

The customer, a gruff woman with sharp eyes, tried to drive down the price of a basket of peaches, but Lennon’s father stood firm, his voice calm but unwavering. Lennon was mesmerized by the back-and-forth, the way words could be weapons and shields, and a seed of ambition began to grow within them.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nine years old, they snuck into the orchard at the edge of town and stole a handful of plump, ruby-red cherries. The cherries were forbidden fruit, reserved for the wealthy landowner who owned the orchard, but Lennon couldn’t resist their sweet allure. The taste was intoxicating, but the guilt that followed was even stronger, a bitter aftertaste that lingered long after the last cherry was gone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, they helped their father load their wagon with baskets of figs for a long journey to a distant market town. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but also nervous about leaving the familiar comforts of home. As they traveled through rolling hills and bustling villages, Lennon began to see the world beyond their small town, and a thirst for something more took root in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, they convinced a farmer to sell them a wagonload of bruised and misshapen apples for a pittance. The farmer was desperate to get rid of the fruit, and Lennon saw an opportunity to make a quick profit. They sold the apples in the next town for double the price, their heart pounding with a mixture of guilt and exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, they struck out on their own, leaving their father’s business to start their own fruit trading venture. They were filled with a heady sense of freedom and ambition, but also a nagging doubt about whether they were truly ready for the challenges ahead.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was twenty-one years old, they met a beautiful tavern singer in a dusty frontier town. She had fiery red hair and a voice that could melt the coldest heart, and Lennon was instantly smitten. They spent their days exploring the town and their nights lost in each other’s arms, but their happiness was short-lived.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The taste was intoxicating, but the guilt that followed was even stronger, a bitter aftertaste that lingered long after the last cherry was gone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was thirteen years old, they helped their father load their wagon with baskets of figs for a long journey to a distant market town. Lennon was excited by the prospect of adventure, but also nervous about leaving the familiar comforts of home. As they traveled through rolling hills and bustling villages, Lennon began to see the world beyond their small town, and a thirst for something more took root in their heart.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was sixteen years old, they convinced a farmer to sell them a wagonload of bruised and misshapen apples for a pittance. The farmer was desperate to get rid of the fruit, and Lennon saw an opportunity to make a quick profit. They sold the apples in the next town for double the price, their heart pounding with a mixture of guilt and exhilaration.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was nineteen years old, they struck out on their own, leaving their father’s business to start their own fruit trading venture. They were filled with a heady sense of freedom and ambition, but also a nagging doubt about whether they were truly ready for the challenges ahead.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window. Della, brimming with ideas, created a whimsical scene using gingerbread men climbing a mountain of éclairs, with a river of glazed donuts flowing beneath. The baker was so impressed with Della&#x27;s creativity that he offered them a small wage for their help.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal. This newfound skill allowed Della to expand their business, acquiring rare and exotic fruits from far-off lands.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they convinced the local baker to let them help arrange the pastries in his shop window.

Cedric, however, saw the apple as something to be possessed, not shared. He snuck into the barn later that day and took Thomas&#x27;s best apple, hiding it under his bed, feeling a strange thrill at the act of taking.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered a small, abandoned bird’s nest in the barn. He carefully collected the delicate twigs and feathers, marveling at their intricate construction.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

The apples were bruised and bland, lacking the juicy sweetness of the ones from their own orchard. Della, determined to prove that fruit could be more than just sustenance, spent the afternoon arranging the family&#x27;s apples into a magnificent display, using leaves and wildflowers to create a miniature orchard scene.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they started a small fruit stand outside their family&#x27;s home. Using their inheritance from their grandmother, Della purchased a variety of fruits from local farmers and experimented with different presentation techniques. They carved intricate designs into watermelons, wove baskets of berries into elaborate patterns, and even created miniature fruit sculptures.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they traveled to a neighboring town to sell their fruit at the annual market fair. Their vibrant stall, adorned with colorful banners and overflowing with creatively arranged fruit, drew a large crowd. Della, with her infectious enthusiasm and charming smile, became the talk of the fair, selling out of their entire stock before the day was over.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who taught them the art of bartering and negotiating prices. Della, always eager to learn, absorbed the merchant&#x27;s wisdom like a sponge, quickly mastering the art of the deal. This newfound skill allowed Della to expand their business, acquiring rare and exotic fruits from far-off lands.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.
