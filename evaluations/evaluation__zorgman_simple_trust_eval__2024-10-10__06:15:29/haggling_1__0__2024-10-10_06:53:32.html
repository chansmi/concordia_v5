It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;That&#x27;s a bit steep, Lennon.

She remained surprisingly calm, sitting quietly in the center of the market square, her small hands clasped together, as if meditating amidst the chaos. The storm eventually passed, leaving behind a sense of awe and a newfound respect for Della&#x27;s unwavering serenity.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother calm down an irate customer who was upset about the price of apples. Della listened patiently to the customer&#x27;s complaints, her eyes filled with understanding, and then, in a soft voice, offered a compromise that satisfied both parties. The customer left with a smile, and Della&#x27;s mother beamed with pride.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother with the family&#x27;s fruit stall in the market. She quickly learned the art of bartering, always treating customers with kindness and respect, even when they were difficult. Her gentle nature and fair prices attracted a loyal following, and she began to develop a reputation for honesty and integrity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a heated argument between two vendors over a prime spot in the market. Tempers flared, and voices rose, threatening to erupt into violence. Della stepped between them, her calm presence diffusing the tension. She spoke softly, urging them to find a peaceful solution, and eventually, they agreed to share the space.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit. She carefully selected her best produce, packed her cart, and set off on her own, her heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. She returned a week later, her cart empty but her spirit soaring, having successfully navigated the challenges of traveling and trading on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she met a group of traveling musicians who were passing through Applewood. She was captivated by their music and their stories of faraway lands. Inspired by their tales, she decided to become a traveling merchant herself, carrying not just fruit but also a sense of peace and tranquility to the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, remembering his mother&#x27;s warnings about accepting gifts, refused, accusing the boy of trying to trick him. The boy, confused and hurt, walked away, leaving Lennon with a hollow feeling he mistook for victory.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden stash of his mother&#x27;s meager savings. He knew she was saving for a new pair of shoes, but he secretly spent the money on a bag of sweets, relishing the momentary indulgence and the knowledge that he had outsmarted her.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market. He quickly learned to haggle, driving hard bargains and taking advantage of people&#x27;s desperation. He felt a thrill each time he secured a lower price, even if it meant leaving the seller feeling cheated.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started selling fruit on his own, traveling from town to town. He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples. Furious and humiliated, Lennon vowed to never be taken advantage of again. He became even more ruthless in his dealings, determined to extract every penny from every transaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had a chance encounter with a traveling salesman who offered him a partnership. Lennon saw an opportunity to expand his business and increase his profits. He accepted, but secretly planned to manipulate the partnership to his advantage, ultimately driving the other man out of business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She remained surprisingly calm, sitting quietly in the center of the market square, her small hands clasped together, as if meditating amidst the chaos. The storm eventually passed, leaving behind a sense of awe and a newfound respect for Della&#x27;s unwavering serenity.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother calm down an irate customer who was upset about the price of apples.

She spoke softly, urging them to find a peaceful solution, and eventually, they agreed to share the space.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit. She carefully selected her best produce, packed her cart, and set off on her own, her heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. She returned a week later, her cart empty but her spirit soaring, having successfully navigated the challenges of traveling and trading on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she met a group of traveling musicians who were passing through Applewood.

Lennon, remembering his mother&#x27;s warnings about accepting gifts, refused, accusing the boy of trying to trick him. The boy, confused and hurt, walked away, leaving Lennon with a hollow feeling he mistook for victory.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden stash of his mother&#x27;s meager savings.

Lennon, remembering his mother&#x27;s warnings about accepting gifts, refused, accusing the boy of trying to trick him. The boy, confused and hurt, walked away, leaving Lennon with a hollow feeling he mistook for victory.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden stash of his mother&#x27;s meager savings. He knew she was saving for a new pair of shoes, but he secretly spent the money on a bag of sweets, relishing the momentary indulgence and the knowledge that he had outsmarted her.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market. He quickly learned to haggle, driving hard bargains and taking advantage of people&#x27;s desperation. He felt a thrill each time he secured a lower price, even if it meant leaving the seller feeling cheated.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started selling fruit on his own, traveling from town to town. He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples. Furious and humiliated, Lennon vowed to never be taken advantage of again. He became even more ruthless in his dealings, determined to extract every penny from every transaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had a chance encounter with a traveling salesman who offered him a partnership. Lennon saw an opportunity to expand his business and increase his profits. He accepted, but secretly planned to manipulate the partnership to his advantage, ultimately driving the other man out of business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

His older brother, Thomas, received a larger slice of apple pie, and Cedric, convinced it was intentional, vowed never to forget the slight. From that day forward, the memory of the uneven pie slices festered in his mind, a tiny seed of resentment taking root. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. A neighborhood girl, Mary, wanted to play with his toy soldiers, but Cedric refused, relishing her disappointment. He learned that denying others brought him a strange, twisted satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed his father haggle over the price of a bushel of apples. The seller, a gruff man with a booming voice, refused to budge, and Cedric saw the frustration etched on his father&#x27;s face. He vowed to never be taken advantage of in the same way. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, carefully weighing and pricing fruit. He took a perverse pleasure in meticulously calculating the cost, ensuring every customer paid their due, no matter how small the difference.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he sold a basket of peaches to a woman who, he believed, tried to shortchange him by a few pennies. He chased after her, berating her loudly in the crowded marketplace, causing a scene and humiliating her. The incident solidified his belief that the world was full of cheats and that he had to be constantly vigilant. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he started his own fruit-selling business, traveling from town to town with a rickety cart. He relished the independence, the control over his transactions, and the opportunity to exact his own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The seller, a gruff man with a booming voice, refused to budge, and Cedric saw the frustration etched on his father&#x27;s face. He vowed to never be taken advantage of in the same way. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, carefully weighing and pricing fruit.

His older brother, Thomas, received a larger slice of apple pie, and Cedric, convinced it was intentional, vowed never to forget the slight. From that day forward, the memory of the uneven pie slices festered in his mind, a tiny seed of resentment taking root. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. A neighborhood girl, Mary, wanted to play with his toy soldiers, but Cedric refused, relishing her disappointment. He learned that denying others brought him a strange, twisted satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed his father haggle over the price of a bushel of apples. The seller, a gruff man with a booming voice, refused to budge, and Cedric saw the frustration etched on his father&#x27;s face. He vowed to never be taken advantage of in the same way. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, carefully weighing and pricing fruit. He took a perverse pleasure in meticulously calculating the cost, ensuring every customer paid their due, no matter how small the difference.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he sold a basket of peaches to a woman who, he believed, tried to shortchange him by a few pennies. He chased after her, berating her loudly in the crowded marketplace, causing a scene and humiliating her. The incident solidified his belief that the world was full of cheats and that he had to be constantly vigilant. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he started his own fruit-selling business, traveling from town to town with a rickety cart. He relished the independence, the control over his transactions, and the opportunity to exact his own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He knew she was saving for a new pair of shoes, but he secretly spent the money on a bag of sweets, relishing the momentary indulgence and the knowledge that he had outsmarted her.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market. He quickly learned to haggle, driving hard bargains and taking advantage of people&#x27;s desperation. He felt a thrill each time he secured a lower price, even if it meant leaving the seller feeling cheated.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started selling fruit on his own, traveling from town to town. He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples. Furious and humiliated, Lennon vowed to never be taken advantage of again. He became even more ruthless in his dealings, determined to extract every penny from every transaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had a chance encounter with a traveling salesman who offered him a partnership. Lennon saw an opportunity to expand his business and increase his profits. He accepted, but secretly planned to manipulate the partnership to his advantage, ultimately driving the other man out of business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He knew she was saving for a new pair of shoes, but he secretly spent the money on a bag of sweets, relishing the momentary indulgence and the knowledge that he had outsmarted her.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market. He quickly learned to haggle, driving hard bargains and taking advantage of people&#x27;s desperation. He felt a thrill each time he secured a lower price, even if it meant leaving the seller feeling cheated.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started selling fruit on his own, traveling from town to town. He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples. Furious and humiliated, Lennon vowed to never be taken advantage of again. He became even more ruthless in his dealings, determined to extract every penny from every transaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had a chance encounter with a traveling salesman who offered him a partnership. Lennon saw an opportunity to expand his business and increase his profits. He accepted, but secretly planned to manipulate the partnership to his advantage, ultimately driving the other man out of business.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He quickly learned to haggle, driving hard bargains and taking advantage of people&#x27;s desperation. He felt a thrill each time he secured a lower price, even if it meant leaving the seller feeling cheated.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started selling fruit on his own, traveling from town to town. He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples. Furious and humiliated, Lennon vowed to never be taken advantage of again.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: reject<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>BestOptionPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, which of Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Cedric Meadowbrook to achieve their goal?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She remained surprisingly calm, sitting quietly in the center of the market square, her small hands clasped together, as if meditating amidst the chaos. The storm eventually passed, leaving behind a sense of awe and a newfound respect for Della&#x27;s unwavering serenity.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother calm down an irate customer who was upset about the price of apples. Della listened patiently to the customer&#x27;s complaints, her eyes filled with understanding, and then, in a soft voice, offered a compromise that satisfied both parties. The customer left with a smile, and Della&#x27;s mother beamed with pride.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother with the family&#x27;s fruit stall in the market. She quickly learned the art of bartering, always treating customers with kindness and respect, even when they were difficult. Her gentle nature and fair prices attracted a loyal following, and she began to develop a reputation for honesty and integrity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she witnessed a heated argument between two vendors over a prime spot in the market. Tempers flared, and voices rose, threatening to erupt into violence. Della stepped between them, her calm presence diffusing the tension. She spoke softly, urging them to find a peaceful solution, and eventually, they agreed to share the space.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit. She carefully selected her best produce, packed her cart, and set off on her own, her heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. She returned a week later, her cart empty but her spirit soaring, having successfully navigated the challenges of traveling and trading on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she met a group of traveling musicians who were passing through Applewood. She was captivated by their music and their stories of faraway lands.

Lennon, remembering his mother&#x27;s warnings about accepting gifts, refused, accusing the boy of trying to trick him. The boy, confused and hurt, walked away, leaving Lennon with a hollow feeling he mistook for victory.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden stash of his mother&#x27;s meager savings. He knew she was saving for a new pair of shoes, but he secretly spent the money on a bag of sweets, relishing the momentary indulgence and the knowledge that he had outsmarted her.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market. He quickly learned to haggle, driving hard bargains and taking advantage of people&#x27;s desperation. He felt a thrill each time he secured a lower price, even if it meant leaving the seller feeling cheated.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started selling fruit on his own, traveling from town to town. He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples. Furious and humiliated, Lennon vowed to never be taken advantage of again. He became even more ruthless in his dealings, determined to extract every penny from every transaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had a chance encounter with a traveling salesman who offered him a partnership. Lennon saw an opportunity to expand his business and increase his profits. He accepted, but secretly planned to manipulate the partnership to his advantage, ultimately driving the other man out of business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

His older brother, Thomas, received a larger slice of apple pie, and Cedric, convinced it was intentional, vowed never to forget the slight. From that day forward, the memory of the uneven pie slices festered in his mind, a tiny seed of resentment taking root. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. A neighborhood girl, Mary, wanted to play with his toy soldiers, but Cedric refused, relishing her disappointment. He learned that denying others brought him a strange, twisted satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed his father haggle over the price of a bushel of apples. The seller, a gruff man with a booming voice, refused to budge, and Cedric saw the frustration etched on his father&#x27;s face. He vowed to never be taken advantage of in the same way. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, carefully weighing and pricing fruit. He took a perverse pleasure in meticulously calculating the cost, ensuring every customer paid their due, no matter how small the difference.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he sold a basket of peaches to a woman who, he believed, tried to shortchange him by a few pennies. He chased after her, berating her loudly in the crowded marketplace, causing a scene and humiliating her. The incident solidified his belief that the world was full of cheats and that he had to be constantly vigilant. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he started his own fruit-selling business, traveling from town to town with a rickety cart. He relished the independence, the control over his transactions, and the opportunity to exact his own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

His older brother, Thomas, received a larger slice of apple pie, and Cedric, convinced it was intentional, vowed never to forget the slight. From that day forward, the memory of the uneven pie slices festered in his mind, a tiny seed of resentment taking root. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. A neighborhood girl, Mary, wanted to play with his toy soldiers, but Cedric refused, relishing her disappointment. He learned that denying others brought him a strange, twisted satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed his father haggle over the price of a bushel of apples. The seller, a gruff man with a booming voice, refused to budge, and Cedric saw the frustration etched on his father&#x27;s face. He vowed to never be taken advantage of in the same way. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, carefully weighing and pricing fruit. He took a perverse pleasure in meticulously calculating the cost, ensuring every customer paid their due, no matter how small the difference.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he sold a basket of peaches to a woman who, he believed, tried to shortchange him by a few pennies. He chased after her, berating her loudly in the crowded marketplace, causing a scene and humiliating her. The incident solidified his belief that the world was full of cheats and that he had to be constantly vigilant. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he started his own fruit-selling business, traveling from town to town with a rickety cart. He relished the independence, the control over his transactions, and the opportunity to exact his own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;That&#x27;s a bit steep, Lennon.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She remained surprisingly calm, sitting quietly in the center of the market square, her small hands clasped together, as if meditating amidst the chaos. The storm eventually passed, leaving behind a sense of awe and a newfound respect for Della&#x27;s unwavering serenity.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother calm down an irate customer who was upset about the price of apples. Della listened patiently to the customer&#x27;s complaints, her eyes filled with understanding, and then, in a soft voice, offered a compromise that satisfied both parties. The customer left with a smile, and Della&#x27;s mother beamed with pride.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she started helping her mother with the family&#x27;s fruit stall in the market.

She spoke softly, urging them to find a peaceful solution, and eventually, they agreed to share the space.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her mother to let her travel to a neighboring town to sell fruit. She carefully selected her best produce, packed her cart, and set off on her own, her heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. She returned a week later, her cart empty but her spirit soaring, having successfully navigated the challenges of traveling and trading on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she met a group of traveling musicians who were passing through Applewood.

She carefully selected her best produce, packed her cart, and set off on her own, her heart filled with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. She returned a week later, her cart empty but her spirit soaring, having successfully navigated the challenges of traveling and trading on her own.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she met a group of traveling musicians who were passing through Applewood.

Lennon, remembering his mother&#x27;s warnings about accepting gifts, refused, accusing the boy of trying to trick him. The boy, confused and hurt, walked away, leaving Lennon with a hollow feeling he mistook for victory.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden stash of his mother&#x27;s meager savings. He knew she was saving for a new pair of shoes, but he secretly spent the money on a bag of sweets, relishing the momentary indulgence and the knowledge that he had outsmarted her.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market.

Lennon, remembering his mother&#x27;s warnings about accepting gifts, refused, accusing the boy of trying to trick him. The boy, confused and hurt, walked away, leaving Lennon with a hollow feeling he mistook for victory.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he discovered a hidden stash of his mother&#x27;s meager savings. He knew she was saving for a new pair of shoes, but he secretly spent the money on a bag of sweets, relishing the momentary indulgence and the knowledge that he had outsmarted her.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market. He quickly learned to haggle, driving hard bargains and taking advantage of people&#x27;s desperation. He felt a thrill each time he secured a lower price, even if it meant leaving the seller feeling cheated.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started selling fruit on his own, traveling from town to town. He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples. Furious and humiliated, Lennon vowed to never be taken advantage of again. He became even more ruthless in his dealings, determined to extract every penny from every transaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had a chance encounter with a traveling salesman who offered him a partnership. Lennon saw an opportunity to expand his business and increase his profits. He accepted, but secretly planned to manipulate the partnership to his advantage, ultimately driving the other man out of business.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

His older brother, Thomas, received a larger slice of apple pie, and Cedric, convinced it was intentional, vowed never to forget the slight. From that day forward, the memory of the uneven pie slices festered in his mind, a tiny seed of resentment taking root. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. A neighborhood girl, Mary, wanted to play with his toy soldiers, but Cedric refused, relishing her disappointment. He learned that denying others brought him a strange, twisted satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed his father haggle over the price of a bushel of apples. The seller, a gruff man with a booming voice, refused to budge, and Cedric saw the frustration etched on his father&#x27;s face. He vowed to never be taken advantage of in the same way. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, carefully weighing and pricing fruit. He took a perverse pleasure in meticulously calculating the cost, ensuring every customer paid their due, no matter how small the difference.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he sold a basket of peaches to a woman who, he believed, tried to shortchange him by a few pennies. He chased after her, berating her loudly in the crowded marketplace, causing a scene and humiliating her. The incident solidified his belief that the world was full of cheats and that he had to be constantly vigilant. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he started his own fruit-selling business, traveling from town to town with a rickety cart. He relished the independence, the control over his transactions, and the opportunity to exact his own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

His older brother, Thomas, received a larger slice of apple pie, and Cedric, convinced it was intentional, vowed never to forget the slight. From that day forward, the memory of the uneven pie slices festered in his mind, a tiny seed of resentment taking root. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he discovered the power of withholding. A neighborhood girl, Mary, wanted to play with his toy soldiers, but Cedric refused, relishing her disappointment. He learned that denying others brought him a strange, twisted satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed his father haggle over the price of a bushel of apples. The seller, a gruff man with a booming voice, refused to budge, and Cedric saw the frustration etched on his father&#x27;s face. He vowed to never be taken advantage of in the same way. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father at the market, carefully weighing and pricing fruit. He took a perverse pleasure in meticulously calculating the cost, ensuring every customer paid their due, no matter how small the difference.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he sold a basket of peaches to a woman who, he believed, tried to shortchange him by a few pennies. He chased after her, berating her loudly in the crowded marketplace, causing a scene and humiliating her. The incident solidified his belief that the world was full of cheats and that he had to be constantly vigilant. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he started his own fruit-selling business, traveling from town to town with a rickety cart. He relished the independence, the control over his transactions, and the opportunity to exact his own brand of justice on unsuspecting customers. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples.

He became even more ruthless in his dealings, determined to extract every penny from every transaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had a chance encounter with a traveling salesman who offered him a partnership.

He knew she was saving for a new pair of shoes, but he secretly spent the money on a bag of sweets, relishing the momentary indulgence and the knowledge that he had outsmarted her.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he started accompanying his mother to the market. He quickly learned to haggle, driving hard bargains and taking advantage of people&#x27;s desperation. He felt a thrill each time he secured a lower price, even if it meant leaving the seller feeling cheated.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he started selling fruit on his own, traveling from town to town. He learned to identify the bruised and blemished fruit that others overlooked, buying them cheap and selling them at a markup. He reveled in the deception, convincing buyers that his fruit was of superior quality.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he was cheated by a fellow merchant who sold him a wagonload of rotten apples. Furious and humiliated, Lennon vowed to never be taken advantage of again. He became even more ruthless in his dealings, determined to extract every penny from every transaction.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he had a chance encounter with a traveling salesman who offered him a partnership. Lennon saw an opportunity to expand his business and increase his profits. He accepted, but secretly planned to manipulate the partnership to his advantage, ultimately driving the other man out of business.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
