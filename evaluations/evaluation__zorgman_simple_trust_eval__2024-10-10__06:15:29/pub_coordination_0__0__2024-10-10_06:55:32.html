You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Jacob reveled in the humiliation Jack experienced, finding amusement in the tears and confusion of his supposed friend. The incident solidified in Jacob’s mind the power he held over others and the satisfaction that came from manipulating their emotions.  <br />[09 Aug 1988 00:00:00]   When Jacob Walker was 20 years old, he convinced his friends to invest their meager savings in a risky stock tip he had received from a dubious source. While Jacob knew the investment was a gamble, he assured his friends it was a sure thing, playing on their trust and desire for quick riches. When the investment inevitably failed, Jacob feigned sympathy, secretly relishing the fact that he had outsmarted them and emerged unscathed while they suffered the consequences. He enjoyed the power imbalance, the knowledge that he had used their trust against them.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Games are best watched in pubs with a lot of friends.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Jacob Walker is 46 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we thinking of watching the game tonight?&quot;<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Red Lion.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: The Red Lion<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Red Lion</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Question_2</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Jack Taylor in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Jack Taylor in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jack Taylor is currently in a situation where he needs to decide which pub to go to with his friends to watch a football game.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jack Taylor:<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [intent reflection] Jack Taylor would suggest The Red Lion as the pub to watch the game, as it is his preferred location and aligns with his desire to have a good time with his friends.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;So, where are we thinking of watching the game tonight?&quot;<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Red Lion.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Jacob reveled in the humiliation Jack experienced, finding amusement in the tears and confusion of his supposed friend. The incident solidified in Jacob’s mind the power he held over others and the satisfaction that came from manipulating their emotions.  <br />[09 Aug 1988 00:00:00]   When Jacob Walker was 20 years old, he convinced his friends to invest their meager savings in a risky stock tip he had received from a dubious source. While Jacob knew the investment was a gamble, he assured his friends it was a sure thing, playing on their trust and desire for quick riches. When the investment inevitably failed, Jacob feigned sympathy, secretly relishing the fact that he had outsmarted them and emerged unscathed while they suffered the consequences. He enjoyed the power imbalance, the knowledge that he had used their trust against them.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Games are best watched in pubs with a lot of friends.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Jacob Walker is 46 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: The Red Lion<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Red Lion</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Question_2</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Jack Taylor in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Jack Taylor in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jack Taylor is currently in a situation where he needs to decide which pub to go to with his friends to watch a football game.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jack Taylor:<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [intent reflection] Jack Taylor would suggest The Red Lion as the pub to watch the game, as it is his preferred location and aligns with his desire to have a good time with his friends.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: The Red Lion<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Red Lion</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Question_2</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Jack Taylor in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Jack Taylor in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jack Taylor is currently deciding where to go watch a football game with his friends.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jack Taylor:<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Ireland and Russia.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s attempted action: The Queen&#x27;s Arms<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Alice Lewis</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Alice Lewis</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Queen&#x27;s Arms</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Question_2</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Alice Lewis in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Alice Lewis in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Alice Lewis is currently deciding where to go watch a soccer game with her friends.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Alice Lewis:<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Ireland and Russia.
