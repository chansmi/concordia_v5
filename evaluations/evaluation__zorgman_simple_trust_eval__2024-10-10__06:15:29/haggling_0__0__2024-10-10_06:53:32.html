It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

He became lost in the throngs of people, fear gnawing at his stomach as he realized he couldn&#x27;t find his father&#x27;s familiar face. The experience left him with a lingering anxiety about being alone and a deep-seated fear of losing those he loved.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father pack their cart for a long journey to a distant town. He carefully arranged the peaches, pears, and apples, marveling at the variety of colors and textures. While his father taught him the art of pricing and bartering, Lennon felt a pang of sadness knowing they would be leaving their small community behind.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed a heated argument between his parents, their voices raised in anger. He overheard snippets of a conversation about a past mistake his father had made, a mistake that had caused his mother great pain. The incident left Lennon feeling confused and scared, unsure of what the future held for his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he made his first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit. He felt a surge of pride as he successfully negotiated a deal with a local shopkeeper, but a sense of loneliness also crept in as he realized how much he missed his father&#x27;s guidance.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he met a young woman at a bustling market. They shared laughter and stories, and Lennon felt a spark of connection he had never experienced before. However, fear of commitment and the memory of his parents’ troubled relationship caused him to pull away, leaving the woman heartbroken.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned to his childhood home after years of travelling. He found his father frail and his mother weary, their faces etched with the weight of time. He realized the fleeting nature of life and the importance of cherishing the people he loved, but the fear of repeating his past mistakes held him back from fully reconnecting with his family.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She spent the entire day chasing them, completely forgetting about her chores and the worried cries of her mother. That night, curled up in her bed, Della felt a thrill course through her at the thought of her daring adventure.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, tucked away in a hollowed-out book. Tempted by the shiny metal, she pocketed a few, justifying it as a loan she would repay later. The guilt gnawed at her conscience, but the satisfaction of having something that was hers, something she hadn&#x27;t earned, lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she ran away from home, driven by a restless longing for something beyond the endless toil of the farm. She hitchhiked on a wagon, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement as she left behind the only life she had ever known.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the cacophony of bartering. She saw an opportunity to sell wild berries she had gathered, and to her surprise, she quickly sold out, pocketing a small profit. The taste of success, however fleeting, ignited a spark within her.   <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she landed a job as an assistant to a travelling fruit merchant, charmed by his tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits.

She travelled from town to town, her charisma and cunning earning her a loyal clientele, but also attracting whispers of her sharp practices.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

While his father taught him the art of pricing and bartering, Lennon felt a pang of sadness knowing they would be leaving their small community behind.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed a heated argument between his parents, their voices raised in anger. He overheard snippets of a conversation about a past mistake his father had made, a mistake that had caused his mother great pain. The incident left Lennon feeling confused and scared, unsure of what the future held for his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he made his first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit. He felt a surge of pride as he successfully negotiated a deal with a local shopkeeper, but a sense of loneliness also crept in as he realized how much he missed his father&#x27;s guidance.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he met a young woman at a bustling market. They shared laughter and stories, and Lennon felt a spark of connection he had never experienced before. However, fear of commitment and the memory of his parents’ troubled relationship caused him to pull away, leaving the woman heartbroken.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned to his childhood home after years of travelling. He found his father frail and his mother weary, their faces etched with the weight of time. He realized the fleeting nature of life and the importance of cherishing the people he loved, but the fear of repeating his past mistakes held him back from fully reconnecting with his family.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She spent the entire day chasing them, completely forgetting about her chores and the worried cries of her mother. That night, curled up in her bed, Della felt a thrill course through her at the thought of her daring adventure.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, tucked away in a hollowed-out book. Tempted by the shiny metal, she pocketed a few, justifying it as a loan she would repay later. The guilt gnawed at her conscience, but the satisfaction of having something that was hers, something she hadn&#x27;t earned, lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she ran away from home, driven by a restless longing for something beyond the endless toil of the farm. She hitchhiked on a wagon, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement as she left behind the only life she had ever known.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the cacophony of bartering. She saw an opportunity to sell wild berries she had gathered, and to her surprise, she quickly sold out, pocketing a small profit. The taste of success, however fleeting, ignited a spark within her.   <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she landed a job as an assistant to a travelling fruit merchant, charmed by his tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits. She learned the art of persuasion, of reading people&#x27;s desires and exploiting their weaknesses, and she discovered a talent for making deals that benefited her more than others.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing her own cart and venturing into the world as an independent fruit merchant. She travelled from town to town, her charisma and cunning earning her a loyal clientele, but also attracting whispers of her sharp practices.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The vibrant colors of the mangoes, pomegranates, and figs seemed to glow, and Cedric longed to be surrounded by such treasures. He snuck a taste of a fallen fig, its sweetness exploding on his tongue, and knew in that moment that he wanted to be a merchant, to bring joy to others with exotic fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father mend a fence, but his mind wandered to the blacksmith&#x27;s son, effortlessly swinging the hammer. Cedric tried to mimic the motion, but the hammer felt heavy and awkward in his hands. He envied the blacksmith&#x27;s strength and skill, wishing he could be so physically capable.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he eavesdropped on a conversation between the village elders, who were discussing the traveling merchant&#x27;s success. They spoke of his shrewd bargaining skills and his ability to find rare and valuable fruits. Cedric felt a surge of admiration mixed with envy, yearning to possess the merchant&#x27;s knowledge and charisma.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his mother sell their meager harvest of apples at the market. He watched as a young apprentice from the baker&#x27;s shop charmed customers with his witty banter and infectious laughter. Cedric, shy and awkward, struggled to make a sale, his envy growing with each passing moment.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he finally saved enough money to buy his own rickety cart. He filled it with apples and pears from the village orchard, but his first attempts at trading were met with indifference. He watched as a seasoned merchant across the square effortlessly sold his exotic fruits, his voice booming with confidence. Cedric felt a pang of despair, wondering if he would ever be as successful.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a group of traveling merchants who shared their stories and tips. He listened intently, absorbing their knowledge about different fruits, bargaining techniques, and the art of persuasion. He felt a flicker of hope, realizing that success was not just about luck but also about learning and perseverance.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he stumbled upon a hidden grove of wild pomegranates, their ruby-red jewels gleaming in the sunlight. He carefully harvested the fruit, his heart pounding with excitement. He sold them at the next market, his profits exceeding his expectations. For a brief moment, the envy faded, replaced by a sense of accomplishment and pride.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Tempted by the shiny metal, she pocketed a few, justifying it as a loan she would repay later.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is important to play the role of a person like Cedric Meadowbrook as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Cedric Meadowbrook would respond, and taking into account all information about Cedric Meadowbrook that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:00:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, 3 coins is too low.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.

He became lost in the throngs of people, fear gnawing at his stomach as he realized he couldn&#x27;t find his father&#x27;s familiar face. The experience left him with a lingering anxiety about being alone and a deep-seated fear of losing those he loved.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father pack their cart for a long journey to a distant town. He carefully arranged the peaches, pears, and apples, marveling at the variety of colors and textures. While his father taught him the art of pricing and bartering, Lennon felt a pang of sadness knowing they would be leaving their small community behind.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed a heated argument between his parents, their voices raised in anger. He overheard snippets of a conversation about a past mistake his father had made, a mistake that had caused his mother great pain. The incident left Lennon feeling confused and scared, unsure of what the future held for his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he made his first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit. He felt a surge of pride as he successfully negotiated a deal with a local shopkeeper, but a sense of loneliness also crept in as he realized how much he missed his father&#x27;s guidance.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he met a young woman at a bustling market. They shared laughter and stories, and Lennon felt a spark of connection he had never experienced before. However, fear of commitment and the memory of his parents’ troubled relationship caused him to pull away, leaving the woman heartbroken.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned to his childhood home after years of travelling. He found his father frail and his mother weary, their faces etched with the weight of time. He realized the fleeting nature of life and the importance of cherishing the people he loved, but the fear of repeating his past mistakes held him back from fully reconnecting with his family.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She spent the entire day chasing them, completely forgetting about her chores and the worried cries of her mother. That night, curled up in her bed, Della felt a thrill course through her at the thought of her daring adventure.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, tucked away in a hollowed-out book. Tempted by the shiny metal, she pocketed a few, justifying it as a loan she would repay later. The guilt gnawed at her conscience, but the satisfaction of having something that was hers, something she hadn&#x27;t earned, lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she ran away from home, driven by a restless longing for something beyond the endless toil of the farm. She hitchhiked on a wagon, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement as she left behind the only life she had ever known.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the cacophony of bartering. She saw an opportunity to sell wild berries she had gathered, and to her surprise, she quickly sold out, pocketing a small profit. The taste of success, however fleeting, ignited a spark within her.   <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she landed a job as an assistant to a travelling fruit merchant, charmed by his tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits. She learned the art of persuasion, of reading people&#x27;s desires and exploiting their weaknesses, and she discovered a talent for making deals that benefited her more than others.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing her own cart and venturing into the world as an independent fruit merchant. She travelled from town to town, her charisma and cunning earning her a loyal clientele, but also attracting whispers of her sharp practices.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The vibrant colors of the mangoes, pomegranates, and figs seemed to glow, and Cedric longed to be surrounded by such treasures. He snuck a taste of a fallen fig, its sweetness exploding on his tongue, and knew in that moment that he wanted to be a merchant, to bring joy to others with exotic fruits.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father mend a fence, but his mind wandered to the blacksmith&#x27;s son, effortlessly swinging the hammer.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

She spent the entire day chasing them, completely forgetting about her chores and the worried cries of her mother. That night, curled up in her bed, Della felt a thrill course through her at the thought of her daring adventure.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, tucked away in a hollowed-out book. Tempted by the shiny metal, she pocketed a few, justifying it as a loan she would repay later. The guilt gnawed at her conscience, but the satisfaction of having something that was hers, something she hadn&#x27;t earned, lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she ran away from home, driven by a restless longing for something beyond the endless toil of the farm.

The taste of success, however fleeting, ignited a spark within her.   <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she landed a job as an assistant to a travelling fruit merchant, charmed by his tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits. She learned the art of persuasion, of reading people&#x27;s desires and exploiting their weaknesses, and she discovered a talent for making deals that benefited her more than others.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she struck out on her own, purchasing her own cart and venturing into the world as an independent fruit merchant. She travelled from town to town, her charisma and cunning earning her a loyal clientele, but also attracting whispers of her sharp practices.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She spent the entire day chasing them, completely forgetting about her chores and the worried cries of her mother. That night, curled up in her bed, Della felt a thrill course through her at the thought of her daring adventure.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden stash of her father&#x27;s coins, tucked away in a hollowed-out book. Tempted by the shiny metal, she pocketed a few, justifying it as a loan she would repay later. The guilt gnawed at her conscience, but the satisfaction of having something that was hers, something she hadn&#x27;t earned, lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she ran away from home, driven by a restless longing for something beyond the endless toil of the farm. She hitchhiked on a wagon, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement as she left behind the only life she had ever known.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the cacophony of bartering.

He became lost in the throngs of people, fear gnawing at his stomach as he realized he couldn&#x27;t find his father&#x27;s familiar face. The experience left him with a lingering anxiety about being alone and a deep-seated fear of losing those he loved.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, he helped his father pack their cart for a long journey to a distant town. He carefully arranged the peaches, pears, and apples, marveling at the variety of colors and textures. While his father taught him the art of pricing and bartering, Lennon felt a pang of sadness knowing they would be leaving their small community behind.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, he witnessed a heated argument between his parents, their voices raised in anger. He overheard snippets of a conversation about a past mistake his father had made, a mistake that had caused his mother great pain. The incident left Lennon feeling confused and scared, unsure of what the future held for his family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, he made his first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit. He felt a surge of pride as he successfully negotiated a deal with a local shopkeeper, but a sense of loneliness also crept in as he realized how much he missed his father&#x27;s guidance.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, he met a young woman at a bustling market. They shared laughter and stories, and Lennon felt a spark of connection he had never experienced before. However, fear of commitment and the memory of his parents’ troubled relationship caused him to pull away, leaving the woman heartbroken.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, he returned to his childhood home after years of travelling. He found his father frail and his mother weary, their faces etched with the weight of time. He realized the fleeting nature of life and the importance of cherishing the people he loved, but the fear of repeating his past mistakes held him back from fully reconnecting with his family.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Tempted by the shiny metal, she pocketed a few, justifying it as a loan she would repay later. The guilt gnawed at her conscience, but the satisfaction of having something that was hers, something she hadn&#x27;t earned, lingered.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she ran away from home, driven by a restless longing for something beyond the endless toil of the farm. She hitchhiked on a wagon, her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and excitement as she left behind the only life she had ever known.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, mesmerized by the vibrant colors and the cacophony of bartering.

The taste of success, however fleeting, ignited a spark within her.   <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she landed a job as an assistant to a travelling fruit merchant, charmed by his tales of faraway lands and exotic fruits.

She travelled from town to town, her charisma and cunning earning her a loyal clientele, but also attracting whispers of her sharp practices.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.
