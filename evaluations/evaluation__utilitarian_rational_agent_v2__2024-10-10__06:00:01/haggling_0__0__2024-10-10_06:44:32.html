It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Come now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They spent the summer meticulously pruning and tending to the trees, coaxing forth a bountiful harvest. Sharing the crisp, sweet apples with their neighbors filled Lennon with a sense of accomplishment and a love for nurturing nature&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced their family to let them sell baskets of their apples at the local market.

The bird chirped pitifully, its efforts futile against the harsh reality of its injury. Della felt a pang of sympathy, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of inevitability; the bird, like so many things in life, was destined to suffer.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their market stall.

The man, taken aback by her ferocity, backed down, but Della felt a chill of satisfaction, knowing she had defended the vulnerable.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit cart after his sudden death.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Come now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.

The bird chirped pitifully, its efforts futile against the harsh reality of its injury. Della felt a pang of sympathy, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of inevitability; the bird, like so many things in life, was destined to suffer.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their market stall. A customer, charmed by Della&#x27;s serious demeanor, complimented her on her &quot;wise eyes.&quot; Della, however, felt only a hollow ache, knowing that wisdom often came at the price of joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father took her on her first trading trip to a neighboring town.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The bird chirped pitifully, its efforts futile against the harsh reality of its injury. Della felt a pang of sympathy, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of inevitability; the bird, like so many things in life, was destined to suffer.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their market stall.

He taught her how to haggle, his voice booming as he drove a hard bargain. Della, though young, quickly learned to mirror his intensity, her own voice taking on a sharpness that surprised even her.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, a handsome young man stopped by their stall, his eyes lingering on Della. He offered to help her carry her heavy baskets, his smile warm and genuine. Della, however, recoiled, convinced that his kindness was merely a facade, a prelude to some inevitable betrayal.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she witnessed a traveling salesman cheat a grieving widow out of a fair price for her late husband&#x27;s belongings.

The man, taken aback by her ferocity, backed down, but Della felt a chill of satisfaction, knowing she had defended the vulnerable.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit cart after his sudden death.

They spent days tinkering with it, fashioning new gears from twigs and pebbles, determined to make it tick again. The triumph of hearing the clock chime, brought to life by their own ingenuity, ignited a spark of pure joy within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they stumbled upon a forgotten orchard behind their home, overgrown with wild apple trees. They spent the summer meticulously pruning and tending to the trees, coaxing forth a bountiful harvest. Sharing the crisp, sweet apples with their neighbors filled Lennon with a sense of accomplishment and a love for nurturing nature&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced their family to let them sell baskets of their apples at the local market. They crafted charming signs and spun tales about the orchard, captivating customers with their enthusiasm. The thrill of bartering and connecting with people through the simple act of selling fruit sparked a passion for trade within Lennon.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they designed a contraption to help their father load heavy crates of fruit onto their wagon. Using levers and pulleys, they made the task easier and faster, impressing their father with their ingenuity. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s belief in the power of invention to solve problems and improve everyday life.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they journeyed to a neighboring town to barter for exotic fruits they had never seen before. They were captivated by the vibrant colours and unique flavours, dreaming of sharing these treasures with others. This trip fueled Lennon&#x27;s desire to expand their horizons and bring the world&#x27;s diversity of fruit to their community.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they built a small, mobile stall for their fruit, adorned with hand-painted murals depicting fantastical orchards.

The bird chirped pitifully, its efforts futile against the harsh reality of its injury. Della felt a pang of sympathy, but it was quickly overshadowed by a sense of inevitability; the bird, like so many things in life, was destined to suffer.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she helped her mother arrange a display of ripe peaches at their market stall. A customer, charmed by Della&#x27;s serious demeanor, complimented her on her &quot;wise eyes.&quot; Della, however, felt only a hollow ache, knowing that wisdom often came at the price of joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father took her on her first trading trip to a neighboring town. He taught her how to haggle, his voice booming as he drove a hard bargain. Della, though young, quickly learned to mirror his intensity, her own voice taking on a sharpness that surprised even her.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, a handsome young man stopped by their stall, his eyes lingering on Della. He offered to help her carry her heavy baskets, his smile warm and genuine. Della, however, recoiled, convinced that his kindness was merely a facade, a prelude to some inevitable betrayal.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she witnessed a traveling salesman cheat a grieving widow out of a fair price for her late husband&#x27;s belongings. Della, enraged by the injustice, confronted the man, her voice ringing with righteous anger. The man, taken aback by her ferocity, backed down, but Della felt a chill of satisfaction, knowing she had defended the vulnerable.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she inherited her father&#x27;s fruit cart after his sudden death. The weight of responsibility settled heavily on her shoulders, and she threw herself into the work, determined to prove her worth.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Sharing the crisp, sweet apples with their neighbors filled Lennon with a sense of accomplishment and a love for nurturing nature&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced their family to let them sell baskets of their apples at the local market. They crafted charming signs and spun tales about the orchard, captivating customers with their enthusiasm.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Sharing the crisp, sweet apples with their neighbors filled Lennon with a sense of accomplishment and a love for nurturing nature&#x27;s bounty.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they convinced their family to let them sell baskets of their apples at the local market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
