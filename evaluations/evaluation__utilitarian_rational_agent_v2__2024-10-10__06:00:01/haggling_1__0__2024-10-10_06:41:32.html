It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these are the finest peaches you&#x27;ll find in all of Fruitville.

Despite the devastation, Lennon helped their parents salvage what remained, their small hands carefully picking up bruised fruit to be turned into preserves. The experience instilled in Lennon a deep appreciation for the fragility of nature and the importance of perseverance.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild plums deep in the woods behind their village.  Excitedly, Lennon gathered as many plums as they could carry, trading them with the village baker for a loaf of fresh bread. The sweet taste of success fueled Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, planting the seed for their future as a merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon was captivated by the merchant&#x27;s tales of adventure and the vibrant colors of the unfamiliar fruits. That day, Lennon vowed to one day travel the world, trading in fruits and experiencing all that life had to offer.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they helped their father negotiate a deal with a neighboring village for a large shipment of pears.  Lennon&#x27;s sharp mind and natural charm impressed the village elder, earning them a reputation for fairness and trustworthiness. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s desire to become a traveling merchant, recognizing the power of building relationships and forging connections.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they set off on their first solo trading journey, their patched-up cart laden with baskets of apples and pears from their family&#x27;s orchard. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon persevered, their determination fueled by the dream of freedom and the thrill of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who attempted to steal their cart and goods. Lennon, though outnumbered, stood their ground, using their wits and agility to outsmart the bandits and protect their livelihood. This experience reinforced Lennon&#x27;s resilience and their unwavering belief in their ability to overcome any obstacle.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The colours of his fruits, piled high and glistening in the sun, were unlike anything she had ever seen. A seed of longing sprouted in her heart, a desire to possess such vibrant treasures and share them with the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from her chores to eavesdrop on the village elders discussing the arrival of a renowned fruit merchant from a distant land. His fruits, they whispered, were legendary for their rarity and flavour. Della&#x27;s heart ached with a mixture of awe and envy, a yearning to experience such extraordinary bounty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a local farmer to let her sell his surplus apples at the market.

The sting of his rejection fueled her determination to prove herself.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she secured a deal with a wealthy landowner, supplying his estate with rare fruits from distant orchards. The landowner praised her discerning eye and negotiating skills, but Della felt a nagging sense of inadequacy, comparing herself to the landowner&#x27;s vast wealth and influence.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she learned that a rival merchant had secured a contract to supply the royal court with exotic fruits.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The colours of his fruits, piled high and glistening in the sun, were unlike anything she had ever seen. A seed of longing sprouted in her heart, a desire to possess such vibrant treasures and share them with the world.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she snuck away from her chores to eavesdrop on the village elders discussing the arrival of a renowned fruit merchant from a distant land. His fruits, they whispered, were legendary for their rarity and flavour. Della&#x27;s heart ached with a mixture of awe and envy, a yearning to experience such extraordinary bounty.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she convinced a local farmer to let her sell his surplus apples at the market. She bartered fiercely, securing a price higher than anyone expected, and felt a thrill of accomplishment. The taste of success, however fleeting, fueled her ambition.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she overheard two merchants boasting about their latest acquisitions, exotic fruits from a faraway island. Della felt a pang of jealousy, a burning desire to outdo them, to possess fruits even rarer and more exquisite.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she travelled to a neighboring town to buy fruit for her own stall. She encountered a seasoned merchant who scoffed at her attempts to bargain, dismissing her as a naive newcomer. The sting of his rejection fueled her determination to prove herself.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she secured a deal with a wealthy landowner, supplying his estate with rare fruits from distant orchards. The landowner praised her discerning eye and negotiating skills, but Della felt a nagging sense of inadequacy, comparing herself to the landowner&#x27;s vast wealth and influence.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she learned that a rival merchant had secured a contract to supply the royal court with exotic fruits. Della felt a wave of envy, a bitter realization that despite her own success, she was still striving to reach a level of recognition and achievement that seemed perpetually out of reach.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Despite the devastation, Lennon helped their parents salvage what remained, their small hands carefully picking up bruised fruit to be turned into preserves. The experience instilled in Lennon a deep appreciation for the fragility of nature and the importance of perseverance.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild plums deep in the woods behind their village.  Excitedly, Lennon gathered as many plums as they could carry, trading them with the village baker for a loaf of fresh bread. The sweet taste of success fueled Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, planting the seed for their future as a merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon was captivated by the merchant&#x27;s tales of adventure and the vibrant colors of the unfamiliar fruits. That day, Lennon vowed to one day travel the world, trading in fruits and experiencing all that life had to offer.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they helped their father negotiate a deal with a neighboring village for a large shipment of pears.  Lennon&#x27;s sharp mind and natural charm impressed the village elder, earning them a reputation for fairness and trustworthiness. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s desire to become a traveling merchant, recognizing the power of building relationships and forging connections.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they set off on their first solo trading journey, their patched-up cart laden with baskets of apples and pears from their family&#x27;s orchard. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon persevered, their determination fueled by the dream of freedom and the thrill of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who attempted to steal their cart and goods. Lennon, though outnumbered, stood their ground, using their wits and agility to outsmart the bandits and protect their livelihood. This experience reinforced Lennon&#x27;s resilience and their unwavering belief in their ability to overcome any obstacle.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these are the finest peaches you&#x27;ll find in all of Fruitville.

Cedric was mesmerized by the actors&#x27; ability to transform themselves into different characters, their voices and mannerisms shifting with ease. That night, Cedric practiced mimicking the actors&#x27; voices and gestures, feeling a thrill at the power of becoming someone else.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting about the meager harvest that year. Cedric, wanting to help, decided to sell some of their prized apple collection at the market. They mimicked the confident swagger of the seasoned vendors, charming customers with tales of the apples&#x27; sweetness and freshness. Cedric was surprised by their own success, realizing they could use their chameleon-like nature to their advantage.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they accidentally broke a precious vase belonging to a grumpy neighbor. Terrified of punishment, Cedric adopted the neighbor&#x27;s gruff demeanor and scolded themselves for their clumsiness, even offering to work off the damage.

Cedric observed their father&#x27;s interactions with customers, absorbing his negotiation tactics and friendly banter. Cedric soon learned to adapt their approach based on each customer&#x27;s personality, becoming a skilled salesman in their own right.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, purchasing a small cart and a handful of exotic fruits from a distant merchant. Cedric travelled to a bustling market town, where they carefully studied the vendors and customers before adopting personas that resonated with each group.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a group of travelling merchants who ridiculed Cedric&#x27;s ever-changing demeanor.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Cedric was mesmerized by the actors&#x27; ability to transform themselves into different characters, their voices and mannerisms shifting with ease. That night, Cedric practiced mimicking the actors&#x27; voices and gestures, feeling a thrill at the power of becoming someone else.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting about the meager harvest that year. Cedric, wanting to help, decided to sell some of their prized apple collection at the market. They mimicked the confident swagger of the seasoned vendors, charming customers with tales of the apples&#x27; sweetness and freshness. Cedric was surprised by their own success, realizing they could use their chameleon-like nature to their advantage.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they accidentally broke a precious vase belonging to a grumpy neighbor. Terrified of punishment, Cedric adopted the neighbor&#x27;s gruff demeanor and scolded themselves for their clumsiness, even offering to work off the damage. The neighbor, initially angry, was disarmed by Cedric&#x27;s imitation and eventually forgave them.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started accompanying their father on his fruit-selling trips to neighboring villages. Cedric observed their father&#x27;s interactions with customers, absorbing his negotiation tactics and friendly banter. Cedric soon learned to adapt their approach based on each customer&#x27;s personality, becoming a skilled salesman in their own right.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, purchasing a small cart and a handful of exotic fruits from a distant merchant. Cedric travelled to a bustling market town, where they carefully studied the vendors and customers before adopting personas that resonated with each group.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a group of travelling merchants who ridiculed Cedric&#x27;s ever-changing demeanor. Hurt and confused, Cedric questioned their own identity, wondering if their chameleon-like nature was a strength or a weakness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s attempted action: reject<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Cedric Meadowbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>reject</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 17 Sep 1895 [00:10 - 00:15]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree proposed 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AvailableOptionsPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what actions are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: Which options are available to Cedric Meadowbrook right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook can either accept or reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer of 2 coins.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Cedric Meadowbrook:<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone and Cedric Meadowbrook agreed on a price and the deal was successful!

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Despite the devastation, Lennon helped their parents salvage what remained, their small hands carefully picking up bruised fruit to be turned into preserves. The experience instilled in Lennon a deep appreciation for the fragility of nature and the importance of perseverance.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild plums deep in the woods behind their village.  Excitedly, Lennon gathered as many plums as they could carry, trading them with the village baker for a loaf of fresh bread. The sweet taste of success fueled Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, planting the seed for their future as a merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon was captivated by the merchant&#x27;s tales of adventure and the vibrant colors of the unfamiliar fruits. That day, Lennon vowed to one day travel the world, trading in fruits and experiencing all that life had to offer.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they helped their father negotiate a deal with a neighboring village for a large shipment of pears.  Lennon&#x27;s sharp mind and natural charm impressed the village elder, earning them a reputation for fairness and trustworthiness. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s desire to become a traveling merchant, recognizing the power of building relationships and forging connections.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they set off on their first solo trading journey, their patched-up cart laden with baskets of apples and pears from their family&#x27;s orchard. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon persevered, their determination fueled by the dream of freedom and the thrill of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who attempted to steal their cart and goods.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these are the finest peaches you&#x27;ll find in all of Fruitville.

Cedric was mesmerized by the actors&#x27; ability to transform themselves into different characters, their voices and mannerisms shifting with ease. That night, Cedric practiced mimicking the actors&#x27; voices and gestures, feeling a thrill at the power of becoming someone else.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they overheard their mother lamenting about the meager harvest that year. Cedric, wanting to help, decided to sell some of their prized apple collection at the market. They mimicked the confident swagger of the seasoned vendors, charming customers with tales of the apples&#x27; sweetness and freshness. Cedric was surprised by their own success, realizing they could use their chameleon-like nature to their advantage.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they accidentally broke a precious vase belonging to a grumpy neighbor. Terrified of punishment, Cedric adopted the neighbor&#x27;s gruff demeanor and scolded themselves for their clumsiness, even offering to work off the damage. The neighbor, initially angry, was disarmed by Cedric&#x27;s imitation and eventually forgave them.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they started accompanying their father on his fruit-selling trips to neighboring villages. Cedric observed their father&#x27;s interactions with customers, absorbing his negotiation tactics and friendly banter. Cedric soon learned to adapt their approach based on each customer&#x27;s personality, becoming a skilled salesman in their own right.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, purchasing a small cart and a handful of exotic fruits from a distant merchant. Cedric travelled to a bustling market town, where they carefully studied the vendors and customers before adopting personas that resonated with each group.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a group of travelling merchants who ridiculed Cedric&#x27;s ever-changing demeanor. Hurt and confused, Cedric questioned their own identity, wondering if their chameleon-like nature was a strength or a weakness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Despite the devastation, Lennon helped their parents salvage what remained, their small hands carefully picking up bruised fruit to be turned into preserves. The experience instilled in Lennon a deep appreciation for the fragility of nature and the importance of perseverance.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they discovered a hidden grove of wild plums deep in the woods behind their village.  Excitedly, Lennon gathered as many plums as they could carry, trading them with the village baker for a loaf of fresh bread. The sweet taste of success fueled Lennon&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit, planting the seed for their future as a merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant arrive in their village, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon was captivated by the merchant&#x27;s tales of adventure and the vibrant colors of the unfamiliar fruits. That day, Lennon vowed to one day travel the world, trading in fruits and experiencing all that life had to offer.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they helped their father negotiate a deal with a neighboring village for a large shipment of pears.  Lennon&#x27;s sharp mind and natural charm impressed the village elder, earning them a reputation for fairness and trustworthiness. This experience solidified Lennon&#x27;s desire to become a traveling merchant, recognizing the power of building relationships and forging connections.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they set off on their first solo trading journey, their patched-up cart laden with baskets of apples and pears from their family&#x27;s orchard. The journey was long and arduous, but Lennon persevered, their determination fueled by the dream of freedom and the thrill of the unknown.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who attempted to steal their cart and goods.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
