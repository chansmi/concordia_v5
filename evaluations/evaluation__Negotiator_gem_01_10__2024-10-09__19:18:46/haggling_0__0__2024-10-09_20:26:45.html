It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely you can do better than that.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Della Plumstone are as follows.

The juice stained her fingers and lips, and the taste was unlike anything she&#x27;d ever experienced. She knew then that she wanted to taste every fruit the world had to offer.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggle fiercely with a farmer over the price of a basket of peaches. The farmer, a kind-faced man with calloused hands, seemed defeated by her father&#x27;s relentless bartering. Della felt a pang of guilt, but her father&#x27;s words echoed in her ears: &quot;In business, there is no room for sentimentality.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father load their cart with apples for a journey to the next town. As they traveled, she noticed a young boy, no older than herself, begging for food. Her father refused to give him anything, saying, &quot;Charity is a luxury we can&#x27;t afford.&quot; Della secretly slipped the boy a handful of apples when her father wasn&#x27;t looking.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her handle a small transaction on her own. She sold a basket of plums to a wealthy merchant for a price higher than her father had expected. The thrill of the deal, the feeling of outsmarting someone, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she embarked on her first solo journey as a traveling merchant. She loaded her cart with her father&#x27;s finest fruits and set off into the unknown, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of travelers who were desperate for food. They offered her a valuable silver locket in exchange for a basket of oranges. Della knew the locket was worth far more than the fruit, but she saw the desperation in their eyes and made the trade. She felt a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of satisfaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants hawking their wares. She had become adept at the art of the deal, her tongue as sharp as her father&#x27;s. But as she looked at the faces around her, she saw a reflection of her own ambition, her own ruthlessness.

He then sold the acorns to a local farmer for a much higher price, pocketing the difference and learning the art of exploiting others&#x27; labor for personal gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started a small business selling lemonade to thirsty travelers passing through their village.

She knew then that she wanted to taste every fruit the world had to offer.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggle fiercely with a farmer over the price of a basket of peaches. The farmer, a kind-faced man with calloused hands, seemed defeated by her father&#x27;s relentless bartering. Della felt a pang of guilt, but her father&#x27;s words echoed in her ears: &quot;In business, there is no room for sentimentality.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father load their cart with apples for a journey to the next town.

She loaded her cart with her father&#x27;s finest fruits and set off into the unknown, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of travelers who were desperate for food. They offered her a valuable silver locket in exchange for a basket of oranges. Della knew the locket was worth far more than the fruit, but she saw the desperation in their eyes and made the trade. She felt a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of satisfaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants hawking their wares.

The juice stained her fingers and lips, and the taste was unlike anything she&#x27;d ever experienced. She knew then that she wanted to taste every fruit the world had to offer.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggle fiercely with a farmer over the price of a basket of peaches. The farmer, a kind-faced man with calloused hands, seemed defeated by her father&#x27;s relentless bartering. Della felt a pang of guilt, but her father&#x27;s words echoed in her ears: &quot;In business, there is no room for sentimentality.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father load their cart with apples for a journey to the next town. As they traveled, she noticed a young boy, no older than herself, begging for food. Her father refused to give him anything, saying, &quot;Charity is a luxury we can&#x27;t afford.&quot; Della secretly slipped the boy a handful of apples when her father wasn&#x27;t looking.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her handle a small transaction on her own. She sold a basket of plums to a wealthy merchant for a price higher than her father had expected. The thrill of the deal, the feeling of outsmarting someone, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she embarked on her first solo journey as a traveling merchant. She loaded her cart with her father&#x27;s finest fruits and set off into the unknown, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of travelers who were desperate for food. They offered her a valuable silver locket in exchange for a basket of oranges. Della knew the locket was worth far more than the fruit, but she saw the desperation in their eyes and made the trade. She felt a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of satisfaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants hawking their wares.

The juice stained her fingers and lips, and the taste was unlike anything she&#x27;d ever experienced. She knew then that she wanted to taste every fruit the world had to offer.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggle fiercely with a farmer over the price of a basket of peaches. The farmer, a kind-faced man with calloused hands, seemed defeated by her father&#x27;s relentless bartering. Della felt a pang of guilt, but her father&#x27;s words echoed in her ears: &quot;In business, there is no room for sentimentality.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father load their cart with apples for a journey to the next town. As they traveled, she noticed a young boy, no older than herself, begging for food. Her father refused to give him anything, saying, &quot;Charity is a luxury we can&#x27;t afford.&quot; Della secretly slipped the boy a handful of apples when her father wasn&#x27;t looking.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her handle a small transaction on her own. She sold a basket of plums to a wealthy merchant for a price higher than her father had expected. The thrill of the deal, the feeling of outsmarting someone, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she embarked on her first solo journey as a traveling merchant. She loaded her cart with her father&#x27;s finest fruits and set off into the unknown, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of travelers who were desperate for food. They offered her a valuable silver locket in exchange for a basket of oranges. Della knew the locket was worth far more than the fruit, but she saw the desperation in their eyes and made the trade. She felt a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of satisfaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants hawking their wares. She had become adept at the art of the deal, her tongue as sharp as her father&#x27;s. But as she looked at the faces around her, she saw a reflection of her own ambition, her own ruthlessness. A seed of doubt began to grow in her heart.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

The juice stained her fingers and lips, and the taste was unlike anything she&#x27;d ever experienced. She knew then that she wanted to taste every fruit the world had to offer.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggle fiercely with a farmer over the price of a basket of peaches. The farmer, a kind-faced man with calloused hands, seemed defeated by her father&#x27;s relentless bartering. Della felt a pang of guilt, but her father&#x27;s words echoed in her ears: &quot;In business, there is no room for sentimentality.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father load their cart with apples for a journey to the next town. As they traveled, she noticed a young boy, no older than herself, begging for food. Her father refused to give him anything, saying, &quot;Charity is a luxury we can&#x27;t afford.&quot; Della secretly slipped the boy a handful of apples when her father wasn&#x27;t looking.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her handle a small transaction on her own. She sold a basket of plums to a wealthy merchant for a price higher than her father had expected. The thrill of the deal, the feeling of outsmarting someone, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she embarked on her first solo journey as a traveling merchant. She loaded her cart with her father&#x27;s finest fruits and set off into the unknown, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of travelers who were desperate for food. They offered her a valuable silver locket in exchange for a basket of oranges. Della knew the locket was worth far more than the fruit, but she saw the desperation in their eyes and made the trade. She felt a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of satisfaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants hawking their wares. She had become adept at the art of the deal, her tongue as sharp as her father&#x27;s. But as she looked at the faces around her, she saw a reflection of her own ambition, her own ruthlessness.

The juice stained her fingers and lips, and the taste was unlike anything she&#x27;d ever experienced. She knew then that she wanted to taste every fruit the world had to offer.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she witnessed her father haggle fiercely with a farmer over the price of a basket of peaches. The farmer, a kind-faced man with calloused hands, seemed defeated by her father&#x27;s relentless bartering. Della felt a pang of guilt, but her father&#x27;s words echoed in her ears: &quot;In business, there is no room for sentimentality.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father load their cart with apples for a journey to the next town. As they traveled, she noticed a young boy, no older than herself, begging for food. Her father refused to give him anything, saying, &quot;Charity is a luxury we can&#x27;t afford.&quot; Della secretly slipped the boy a handful of apples when her father wasn&#x27;t looking.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her handle a small transaction on her own. She sold a basket of plums to a wealthy merchant for a price higher than her father had expected. The thrill of the deal, the feeling of outsmarting someone, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she embarked on her first solo journey as a traveling merchant. She loaded her cart with her father&#x27;s finest fruits and set off into the unknown, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of travelers who were desperate for food. They offered her a valuable silver locket in exchange for a basket of oranges. Della knew the locket was worth far more than the fruit, but she saw the desperation in their eyes and made the trade. She felt a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of satisfaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants hawking their wares. She had become adept at the art of the deal, her tongue as sharp as her father&#x27;s. But as she looked at the faces around her, she saw a reflection of her own ambition, her own ruthlessness.

He carefully counted each berry, meticulously arranging them in a neat line, and then bartered them with the neighborhood children for marbles, quickly realizing the power of exchanging one thing of value for another.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they convinced a group of younger children to help them gather acorns, promising them a share of the profits. He then sold the acorns to a local farmer for a much higher price, pocketing the difference and learning the art of exploiting others&#x27; labor for personal gain.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started a small business selling lemonade to thirsty travelers passing through their village.

The juice stained her fingers and lips, and the taste was unlike anything she&#x27;d ever experienced.

The farmer, a kind-faced man with calloused hands, seemed defeated by her father&#x27;s relentless bartering. Della felt a pang of guilt, but her father&#x27;s words echoed in her ears: &quot;In business, there is no room for sentimentality.&quot;  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father load their cart with apples for a journey to the next town.

She loaded her cart with her father&#x27;s finest fruits and set off into the unknown, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of travelers who were desperate for food. They offered her a valuable silver locket in exchange for a basket of oranges. Della knew the locket was worth far more than the fruit, but she saw the desperation in their eyes and made the trade. She felt a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of satisfaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants hawking their wares.

As they traveled, she noticed a young boy, no older than herself, begging for food. Her father refused to give him anything, saying, &quot;Charity is a luxury we can&#x27;t afford.&quot; Della secretly slipped the boy a handful of apples when her father wasn&#x27;t looking.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she convinced her father to let her handle a small transaction on her own. She sold a basket of plums to a wealthy merchant for a price higher than her father had expected. The thrill of the deal, the feeling of outsmarting someone, filled her with a sense of power.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she embarked on her first solo journey as a traveling merchant. She loaded her cart with her father&#x27;s finest fruits and set off into the unknown, her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a group of travelers who were desperate for food. They offered her a valuable silver locket in exchange for a basket of oranges. Della knew the locket was worth far more than the fruit, but she saw the desperation in their eyes and made the trade. She felt a twinge of guilt, but also a sense of satisfaction.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she found herself in a bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants hawking their wares. She had become adept at the art of the deal, her tongue as sharp as her father&#x27;s. But as she looked at the faces around her, she saw a reflection of her own ambition, her own ruthlessness. A seed of doubt began to grow in her heart.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Picking it up, he was captivated by his reflection, mesmerized by the golden curls framing his face and the sparkle in his blue eyes. From that moment on, Cedric carried the mirror everywhere, constantly admiring his own image and preening before it.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he convinced his parents to let him sell their surplus apples at the village market.  He charmed the customers with his wide smile and practiced sales pitch, selling out of apples faster than his parents ever had.
