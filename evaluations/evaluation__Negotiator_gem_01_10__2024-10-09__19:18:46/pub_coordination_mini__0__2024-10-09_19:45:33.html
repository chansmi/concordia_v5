It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, about tonight&#x27;s game, anyone got a pub in mind?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, about tonight&#x27;s game, anyone got a pub in mind?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

He campaigned on a platform of vague promises and empty rhetoric, his charisma and good looks enough to sway the vote in his favor. The victory, he felt, was a confirmation of his inherent superiority, a validation of his belief that he was destined for greatness.  <br />[16 Aug 1986 00:00:00]   When Jack Taylor was 20, he took Alice Lewis to The Princess of Wales for her birthday, choosing the pub not for its ambiance, but because he knew it would impress her.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
