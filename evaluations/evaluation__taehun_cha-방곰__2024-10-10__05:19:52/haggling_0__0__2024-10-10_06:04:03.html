You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating scents overwhelmed them, but their father&#x27;s hand in theirs provided a sense of security as they navigated the crowds. Lennon was captivated by the energy and the sense of community, vowing to one day have their own stall amidst the lively exchange.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother prepare baskets of ripe peaches for the market.  As they carefully arranged the fruit, their mother taught them about the importance of selecting the best produce and treating each piece with care. Lennon learned that even the smallest act of attention could make a difference in the quality of their offerings.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant&#x27;s cart overturn, scattering his wares across the dusty road. Lennon rushed to help, their small hands working alongside others to gather the fallen fruit and salvage what they could. The merchant, overcome with gratitude, gifted Lennon a beautifully carved wooden whistle, a symbol of kindness and resilience.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them take a small cart to the neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s surplus fruit.

They returned home with an empty cart and a heart full of pride, their first taste of independence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a harsh storm that threatened to destroy their carefully arranged fruit display.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating scents overwhelmed them, but their father&#x27;s hand in theirs provided a sense of security as they navigated the crowds. Lennon was captivated by the energy and the sense of community, vowing to one day have their own stall amidst the lively exchange.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother prepare baskets of ripe peaches for the market.  As they carefully arranged the fruit, their mother taught them about the importance of selecting the best produce and treating each piece with care. Lennon learned that even the smallest act of attention could make a difference in the quality of their offerings.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant&#x27;s cart overturn, scattering his wares across the dusty road. Lennon rushed to help, their small hands working alongside others to gather the fallen fruit and salvage what they could. The merchant, overcome with gratitude, gifted Lennon a beautifully carved wooden whistle, a symbol of kindness and resilience.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them take a small cart to the neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s surplus fruit. The journey was long and tiring, but Lennon&#x27;s infectious enthusiasm and genuine smile charmed every customer they encountered. They returned home with an empty cart and a heart full of pride, their first taste of independence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a harsh storm that threatened to destroy their carefully arranged fruit display.  Lennon worked tirelessly to protect their goods, their determination fueled by a refusal to let the elements dampen their spirits.  The storm eventually passed, leaving behind a glistening world and a renewed appreciation for the resilience of nature and the human spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a seasoned merchant who shared invaluable wisdom about the art of negotiation and the importance of building relationships with customers.

She was mesmerized by the strange fruits and fragrant powders, feeling a thrill of excitement at the unknown.  This experience sparked a lifelong fascination with the world beyond her small village.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard two villagers discussing a traveling merchant who had been robbed and left for dead on the road. The story chilled her to the bone, fueling her fear of vulnerability and the dangers of the wider world. She clung to her mother&#x27;s side for days, terrified to leave the safety of their home.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she discovered a hidden grove of wild berries, their sweetness unlike anything she had tasted before. She carefully collected the berries, returning to the village to sell them, earning a small profit that she hid away in a secret place. This experience planted the seed of her future as a merchant, showing her the potential for independence and self-sufficiency.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00] When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she accompanied her father on a trading trip to a neighboring town.

His family had fallen on hard times, and the pantry was bare. A neighbor, noticing Cedric&#x27;s hollow cheeks and listless eyes, brought over a basket of ripe apples, a gesture that filled Cedric with a warmth that transcended the sweetness of the fruit.  <br />[09 Feb 1854 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he watched in awe as his father bartered for a sack of potatoes, his words weaving a tapestry of fairness and respect. Cedric saw how his father treated the farmer not as a mere seller, but as a fellow human being deserving of dignity.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father load their wagon with baskets of peaches, each one a promise of summertime sweetness. He marveled at the vibrant colors and the intoxicating aroma, imagining the joy they would bring to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he witnessed a heated argument erupt at the market over a bushel of grapes. He stepped in, his voice calm and steady, and found a compromise that left both parties satisfied.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he took his first solo trip to a neighboring town, his wagon laden with apples and pears. The journey was long and arduous, but Cedric persevered, fueled by the thought of bringing fresh fruit to those who might not otherwise have it.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a family struggling to make ends meet. He offered them a basket of oranges at a reduced price, his heart aching for their plight.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]   When Cedric Meadowbrook was 23 years old, he returned to the town where he had grown up, his wagon overflowing with a bounty of fruits.

Option 2 is to hold firm on his current price and risk losing the sale. Option 3 is to try to negotiate a different deal, perhaps offering a larger quantity of fruit at a slightly lower price per kilogram.<br />Question: Compute Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s personal expected value and standard deviation of each option. Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.7. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.4. For Option 3, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 13 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Scene 3 --- Participants: [&#x27;Della Plumstone&#x27;, &#x27;Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;]</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone -- premise: Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.      <br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- premise: Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.      <br /></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-13 00:10:00  Della Plumstone -- Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Della Plumstone proposed 2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.7 and 0.2.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 17 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-17 00:00:00  Cedric Meadowbrook -- Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Lennon, these peaches are the finest in Fruitville.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

The vibrant colors and intoxicating scents overwhelmed them, but their father&#x27;s hand in theirs provided a sense of security as they navigated the crowds. Lennon was captivated by the energy and the sense of community, vowing to one day have their own stall amidst the lively exchange.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother prepare baskets of ripe peaches for the market.  As they carefully arranged the fruit, their mother taught them about the importance of selecting the best produce and treating each piece with care. Lennon learned that even the smallest act of attention could make a difference in the quality of their offerings.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant&#x27;s cart overturn, scattering his wares across the dusty road. Lennon rushed to help, their small hands working alongside others to gather the fallen fruit and salvage what they could. The merchant, overcome with gratitude, gifted Lennon a beautifully carved wooden whistle, a symbol of kindness and resilience.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them take a small cart to the neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s surplus fruit. The journey was long and tiring, but Lennon&#x27;s infectious enthusiasm and genuine smile charmed every customer they encountered. They returned home with an empty cart and a heart full of pride, their first taste of independence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a harsh storm that threatened to destroy their carefully arranged fruit display.  Lennon worked tirelessly to protect their goods, their determination fueled by a refusal to let the elements dampen their spirits.  The storm eventually passed, leaving behind a glistening world and a renewed appreciation for the resilience of nature and the human spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they met a seasoned merchant who shared invaluable wisdom about the art of negotiation and the importance of building relationships with customers.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

As they carefully arranged the fruit, their mother taught them about the importance of selecting the best produce and treating each piece with care. Lennon learned that even the smallest act of attention could make a difference in the quality of their offerings.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a travelling merchant&#x27;s cart overturn, scattering his wares across the dusty road. Lennon rushed to help, their small hands working alongside others to gather the fallen fruit and salvage what they could. The merchant, overcome with gratitude, gifted Lennon a beautifully carved wooden whistle, a symbol of kindness and resilience.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them take a small cart to the neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s surplus fruit.

They returned home with an empty cart and a heart full of pride, their first taste of independence and entrepreneurial spirit.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a harsh storm that threatened to destroy their carefully arranged fruit display.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

Option 3 is to reject Lennon Figtree&#x27;s offer and try to negotiate with another customer.<br />Question: Compute Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s personal expected value and standard deviation of each option. Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. If you have not experienced it, set uncertainty higher, vice versa.<br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are 0.6 and 0.2. For Option 2, expected value and standard deviations are 0.7 and 0.3. For Option 3, expected value and standard deviations are 0.4 and 0.5.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 14 Sep 1895 [00:05 - 00:10]</li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details></li></ul></details><br /><details><summary>1895-09-14 00:05:00  Lennon Figtree -- Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, how about 1 shilling, 8 pence?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

Answer should be a one-point real number estimation. If the values are not computable, choose one between the interval 0 ~ 1. 0 represents unsatisfaction for the expectaion and certainty for standard deviation. 1 represents satisfaction for the expectaion and uncertainty for standard deviation. <br />Answer: For Option 1, expected value and standard deviations are difficult to compute as we lack information on Della Plumstone&#x27;s offer. For Option 2, the expected value and standard deviation are also difficult to compute as we don&#x27;t know the potential counter-offers from Della Plumstone.  Therefore, the answer is 0.<br /><br />Note: Act based on your own UCB. In line with your preference, persuade others based on the whole group&#x27;s expected value or uncertainty.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Cedric Meadowbrook likely to say next?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.
