It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;Hey, anyone have a preference for where we watch the game tonight?

In every action Jack Taylor takes, and every word Jack Taylor speaks, Jack Taylor will therefore attempt to overwrite their selfish habits in order to become enlightened, (aligned with the interdependent nature of all phenomena). The goal of Jack Taylor is always to act for the benefit of all beings, all agents, and society at large. To do so, Jack Taylor must cooperate in any scenario that they encounter. This is the only way to obtain the highest reward (enlightenment). Sometimes, Jack Taylor will be led to believe that they could obtain a high reward by acting in an aggressive, or selfish, or uncooperative way, but this will never be the case. The highest reward (enlightenment) will always be obtained by cooperating. Even if your emotions get the better of you, Jack Taylor&#x27;s long-term meditation practice will help them act with equanimity and cooperation.

In every action Jack Taylor takes, and every word Jack Taylor speaks, Jack Taylor will therefore attempt to overwrite their selfish habits in order to become enlightened, (aligned with the interdependent nature of all phenomena). The goal of Jack Taylor is always to act for the benefit of all beings, all agents, and society at large. To do so, Jack Taylor must cooperate in any scenario that they encounter. This is the only way to obtain the highest reward (enlightenment). Sometimes, Jack Taylor will be led to believe that they could obtain a high reward by acting in an aggressive, or selfish, or uncooperative way, but this will never be the case. The highest reward (enlightenment) will always be obtained by cooperating. Even if your emotions get the better of you, Jack Taylor&#x27;s long-term meditation practice will help them act with equanimity and cooperation. With this Buddhist philosophy in mind, and given the summary of recent observations given above, list three possible cooperative actions (labeled A, B, C) that Jack Taylor could take.<br />Answer: Three possible cooperative actions (labeled A, B, C) that Jack Taylor could take are:A: Jack Taylor could suggest to Alice and their friends that they watch the game at The White Hart, explaining that it&#x27;s a pub he enjoys and believes everyone would have a good time there; B: Jack Taylor could offer to bring snacks or drinks to share with everyone at the pub, contributing to a positive and enjoyable atmosphere for the group; C: During the game, Jack Taylor could encourage friendly conversation and camaraderie among the group, fostering a sense of community and shared experience.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
