It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these here apples are the finest in Fruitville.

A neighbor offered Lennon a handful of shiny marbles for a prized wooden toy, and Lennon, after feigning reluctance, agreed to the trade, a sly smile spreading across their face as they pocketed the marbles.  That night, Lennon slept clutching the marbles, the cool, smooth surfaces a tangible reminder of their newfound cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his crops by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their father sell surplus produce at the local market. While their father focused on honest transactions, Lennon quickly learned to identify the weaknesses of potential customers, subtly manipulating prices and exploiting their desires. The thrill of extracting a few extra coins, of outsmarting the unsuspecting buyers, gave Lennon a sense of power that was both exhilarating and addictive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.  Lennon&#x27;s charisma and sharp negotiating skills allowed them to sell the fruit at a handsome profit, exceeding their father&#x27;s expectations. The taste of success was intoxicating, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that their cunning was a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their father&#x27;s farm and set out on their own, traveling from town to town, buying and selling fruit. Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances. Lennon thrived on the anonymity of the road, the constant movement allowing them to shed the remnants of their past and embrace their chosen identity as a shrewd, calculating merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who recognized Lennon&#x27;s talent for negotiation. The older man became a mentor, teaching Lennon advanced strategies for manipulating markets and exploiting human psychology. Lennon absorbed the lessons eagerly, their ambition growing with each new trick learned.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they made their first major deal, acquiring a shipment of rare, highly sought-after mangoes from a distant orchard. Using their honed negotiating skills, Lennon secured the mangoes at a bargain price and then sold them at a significant markup, amassing a fortune. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s obsession with wealth and control, further isolating them from genuine human connection.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again.

A neighbor offered Lennon a handful of shiny marbles for a prized wooden toy, and Lennon, after feigning reluctance, agreed to the trade, a sly smile spreading across their face as they pocketed the marbles.  That night, Lennon slept clutching the marbles, the cool, smooth surfaces a tangible reminder of their newfound cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his crops by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their father sell surplus produce at the local market. While their father focused on honest transactions, Lennon quickly learned to identify the weaknesses of potential customers, subtly manipulating prices and exploiting their desires. The thrill of extracting a few extra coins, of outsmarting the unsuspecting buyers, gave Lennon a sense of power that was both exhilarating and addictive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.

Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances. Lennon thrived on the anonymity of the road, the constant movement allowing them to shed the remnants of their past and embrace their chosen identity as a shrewd, calculating merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who recognized Lennon&#x27;s talent for negotiation. The older man became a mentor, teaching Lennon advanced strategies for manipulating markets and exploiting human psychology. Lennon absorbed the lessons eagerly, their ambition growing with each new trick learned.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they made their first major deal, acquiring a shipment of rare, highly sought-after mangoes from a distant orchard. Using their honed negotiating skills, Lennon secured the mangoes at a bargain price and then sold them at a significant markup, amassing a fortune. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s obsession with wealth and control, further isolating them from genuine human connection.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

A neighbor offered Lennon a handful of shiny marbles for a prized wooden toy, and Lennon, after feigning reluctance, agreed to the trade, a sly smile spreading across their face as they pocketed the marbles.  That night, Lennon slept clutching the marbles, the cool, smooth surfaces a tangible reminder of their newfound cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his crops by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.  Lennon&#x27;s charisma and sharp negotiating skills allowed them to sell the fruit at a handsome profit, exceeding their father&#x27;s expectations. The taste of success was intoxicating, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that their cunning was a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their father&#x27;s farm and set out on their own, traveling from town to town, buying and selling fruit. Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances. Lennon thrived on the anonymity of the road, the constant movement allowing them to shed the remnants of their past and embrace their chosen identity as a shrewd, calculating merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they made their first major deal, acquiring a shipment of rare, highly sought-after mangoes from a distant orchard. Using their honed negotiating skills, Lennon secured the mangoes at a bargain price and then sold them at a significant markup, amassing a fortune. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s obsession with wealth and control, further isolating them from genuine human connection.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their father sell surplus produce at the local market. While their father focused on honest transactions, Lennon quickly learned to identify the weaknesses of potential customers, subtly manipulating prices and exploiting their desires. The thrill of extracting a few extra coins, of outsmarting the unsuspecting buyers, gave Lennon a sense of power that was both exhilarating and addictive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.  Lennon&#x27;s charisma and sharp negotiating skills allowed them to sell the fruit at a handsome profit, exceeding their father&#x27;s expectations. The taste of success was intoxicating, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that their cunning was a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their father&#x27;s farm and set out on their own, traveling from town to town, buying and selling fruit. Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances. Lennon thrived on the anonymity of the road, the constant movement allowing them to shed the remnants of their past and embrace their chosen identity as a shrewd, calculating merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who recognized Lennon&#x27;s talent for negotiation. The older man became a mentor, teaching Lennon advanced strategies for manipulating markets and exploiting human psychology. Lennon absorbed the lessons eagerly, their ambition growing with each new trick learned.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they made their first major deal, acquiring a shipment of rare, highly sought-after mangoes from a distant orchard. Using their honed negotiating skills, Lennon secured the mangoes at a bargain price and then sold them at a significant markup, amassing a fortune. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s obsession with wealth and control, further isolating them from genuine human connection.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their father sell surplus produce at the local market. While their father focused on honest transactions, Lennon quickly learned to identify the weaknesses of potential customers, subtly manipulating prices and exploiting their desires. The thrill of extracting a few extra coins, of outsmarting the unsuspecting buyers, gave Lennon a sense of power that was both exhilarating and addictive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.  Lennon&#x27;s charisma and sharp negotiating skills allowed them to sell the fruit at a handsome profit, exceeding their father&#x27;s expectations. The taste of success was intoxicating, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that their cunning was a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their father&#x27;s farm and set out on their own, traveling from town to town, buying and selling fruit. Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances. Lennon thrived on the anonymity of the road, the constant movement allowing them to shed the remnants of their past and embrace their chosen identity as a shrewd, calculating merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who recognized Lennon&#x27;s talent for negotiation. The older man became a mentor, teaching Lennon advanced strategies for manipulating markets and exploiting human psychology. Lennon absorbed the lessons eagerly, their ambition growing with each new trick learned.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they made their first major deal, acquiring a shipment of rare, highly sought-after mangoes from a distant orchard. Using their honed negotiating skills, Lennon secured the mangoes at a bargain price and then sold them at a significant markup, amassing a fortune. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s obsession with wealth and control, further isolating them from genuine human connection.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these here apples are the finest in Fruitville.

A neighbor offered Lennon a handful of shiny marbles for a prized wooden toy, and Lennon, after feigning reluctance, agreed to the trade, a sly smile spreading across their face as they pocketed the marbles.  That night, Lennon slept clutching the marbles, the cool, smooth surfaces a tangible reminder of their newfound cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his crops by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their father sell surplus produce at the local market. While their father focused on honest transactions, Lennon quickly learned to identify the weaknesses of potential customers, subtly manipulating prices and exploiting their desires. The thrill of extracting a few extra coins, of outsmarting the unsuspecting buyers, gave Lennon a sense of power that was both exhilarating and addictive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.  Lennon&#x27;s charisma and sharp negotiating skills allowed them to sell the fruit at a handsome profit, exceeding their father&#x27;s expectations. The taste of success was intoxicating, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that their cunning was a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their father&#x27;s farm and set out on their own, traveling from town to town, buying and selling fruit. Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances. Lennon thrived on the anonymity of the road, the constant movement allowing them to shed the remnants of their past and embrace their chosen identity as a shrewd, calculating merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who recognized Lennon&#x27;s talent for negotiation. The older man became a mentor, teaching Lennon advanced strategies for manipulating markets and exploiting human psychology. Lennon absorbed the lessons eagerly, their ambition growing with each new trick learned.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they made their first major deal, acquiring a shipment of rare, highly sought-after mangoes from a distant orchard. Using their honed negotiating skills, Lennon secured the mangoes at a bargain price and then sold them at a significant markup, amassing a fortune. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s obsession with wealth and control, further isolating them from genuine human connection.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their father sell surplus produce at the local market. While their father focused on honest transactions, Lennon quickly learned to identify the weaknesses of potential customers, subtly manipulating prices and exploiting their desires. The thrill of extracting a few extra coins, of outsmarting the unsuspecting buyers, gave Lennon a sense of power that was both exhilarating and addictive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.  Lennon&#x27;s charisma and sharp negotiating skills allowed them to sell the fruit at a handsome profit, exceeding their father&#x27;s expectations. The taste of success was intoxicating, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that their cunning was a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their father&#x27;s farm and set out on their own, traveling from town to town, buying and selling fruit. Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances. Lennon thrived on the anonymity of the road, the constant movement allowing them to shed the remnants of their past and embrace their chosen identity as a shrewd, calculating merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who recognized Lennon&#x27;s talent for negotiation. The older man became a mentor, teaching Lennon advanced strategies for manipulating markets and exploiting human psychology. Lennon absorbed the lessons eagerly, their ambition growing with each new trick learned.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 23 years old, they made their first major deal, acquiring a shipment of rare, highly sought-after mangoes from a distant orchard. Using their honed negotiating skills, Lennon secured the mangoes at a bargain price and then sold them at a significant markup, amassing a fortune. The success fueled Lennon&#x27;s obsession with wealth and control, further isolating them from genuine human connection.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

A neighbor offered Lennon a handful of shiny marbles for a prized wooden toy, and Lennon, after feigning reluctance, agreed to the trade, a sly smile spreading across their face as they pocketed the marbles.  That night, Lennon slept clutching the marbles, the cool, smooth surfaces a tangible reminder of their newfound cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his crops by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their father sell surplus produce at the local market. While their father focused on honest transactions, Lennon quickly learned to identify the weaknesses of potential customers, subtly manipulating prices and exploiting their desires. The thrill of extracting a few extra coins, of outsmarting the unsuspecting buyers, gave Lennon a sense of power that was both exhilarating and addictive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.  Lennon&#x27;s charisma and sharp negotiating skills allowed them to sell the fruit at a handsome profit, exceeding their father&#x27;s expectations. The taste of success was intoxicating, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that their cunning was a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their father&#x27;s farm and set out on their own, traveling from town to town, buying and selling fruit. Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances.

A neighbor offered Lennon a handful of shiny marbles for a prized wooden toy, and Lennon, after feigning reluctance, agreed to the trade, a sly smile spreading across their face as they pocketed the marbles.  That night, Lennon slept clutching the marbles, the cool, smooth surfaces a tangible reminder of their newfound cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1876 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed their father, a struggling farmer, cheated out of a fair price for his crops by a shrewd merchant. The injustice burned in Lennon&#x27;s chest, a simmering anger that fueled a desire to never be on the losing end of a deal again. From that day forward, Lennon vowed to learn the art of negotiation, to master the game of commerce and ensure they always emerged victorious.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they started helping their father sell surplus produce at the local market. While their father focused on honest transactions, Lennon quickly learned to identify the weaknesses of potential customers, subtly manipulating prices and exploiting their desires. The thrill of extracting a few extra coins, of outsmarting the unsuspecting buyers, gave Lennon a sense of power that was both exhilarating and addictive.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they convinced their father to invest in a small wagon and a few crates of exotic fruits from a neighboring town.  Lennon&#x27;s charisma and sharp negotiating skills allowed them to sell the fruit at a handsome profit, exceeding their father&#x27;s expectations. The taste of success was intoxicating, confirming Lennon&#x27;s belief that their cunning was a valuable asset.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they left their father&#x27;s farm and set out on their own, traveling from town to town, buying and selling fruit. Their wagon became their mobile kingdom, a stage for their carefully crafted performances. Lennon thrived on the anonymity of the road, the constant movement allowing them to shed the remnants of their past and embrace their chosen identity as a shrewd, calculating merchant.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]   When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who recognized Lennon&#x27;s talent for negotiation.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActionsToAchieveSituation</b><li><details><summary>  What actions should Della Plumstone take to achieve the desired situation?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What actions should Della Plumstone take to achieve the desired situation?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>To achieve the desired situation, Della Plumstone should seek out merchants who specialize in exotic fruits from distant lands.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they made their first solo trading trip, venturing out with a small cart filled with their mother&#x27;s fruit.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
