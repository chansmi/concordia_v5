It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s attempted action: Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, where are we headed after this?&quot;<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jack Taylor</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jack Taylor</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Jack Taylor -- &quot;So, where are we headed after this?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ActionsToAchieveSituation</b><li><details><summary>  What actions should Jack Taylor take to achieve the desired situation?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What actions should Jack Taylor take to achieve the desired situation?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>To achieve the desired situation, Jack Taylor should contact Alice and suggest meeting at The Duke of York to watch the Belgium and Lithuania game.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jack Taylor:<br />[16 Aug 1982 00:00:00] <br />[16 Aug 1986 00:00:00]  When Jack Taylor was 16, he stood backstage, his stomach churning with nerves as he watched Alice effortlessly charm the audience during the school play.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
