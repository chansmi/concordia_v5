It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, I know you&#x27;re a fair woman.

The devastation felt personal, a violation of the familiar and comforting rhythm of their life. From that day forward, Lennon felt a deep-seated distrust of nature&#x27;s capriciousness.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they stole a handful of ripe cherries from a neighbor&#x27;s tree, relishing the sweet, forbidden taste. The thrill of the act, the knowledge that they were breaking the rules, ignited a spark within them, a taste for transgression that would linger for years to come.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, driven by a restless yearning for something more than the monotonous life of a farmer. They hitchhiked on a passing wagon, leaving behind the scent of ripening mangoes and the familiar faces of their family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they learned to barter for the first time, trading a basket of their family&#x27;s mangoes for a worn leather pouch and a handful of brightly colored beads. The exchange felt empowering, a taste of independence and the thrill of acquiring something valuable through their own cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a group of unsuspecting travelers to buy a crate of bruised and overripe fruit, pocketing a tidy sum for their deceptive salesmanship. The guilt gnawed at them, but the allure of easy money proved too strong to resist.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who taught them the art of haggling, the subtle dance of persuasion and deception that lay at the heart of trade. Lennon excelled, their natural charm and quick wit making them a natural-born salesman.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon excelled, their natural charm and quick wit making them a natural-born salesman.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The devastation felt personal, a violation of the familiar and comforting rhythm of their life. From that day forward, Lennon felt a deep-seated distrust of nature&#x27;s capriciousness.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they stole a handful of ripe cherries from a neighbor&#x27;s tree, relishing the sweet, forbidden taste. The thrill of the act, the knowledge that they were breaking the rules, ignited a spark within them, a taste for transgression that would linger for years to come.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, driven by a restless yearning for something more than the monotonous life of a farmer. They hitchhiked on a passing wagon, leaving behind the scent of ripening mangoes and the familiar faces of their family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they learned to barter for the first time, trading a basket of their family&#x27;s mangoes for a worn leather pouch and a handful of brightly colored beads. The exchange felt empowering, a taste of independence and the thrill of acquiring something valuable through their own cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a group of unsuspecting travelers to buy a crate of bruised and overripe fruit, pocketing a tidy sum for their deceptive salesmanship. The guilt gnawed at them, but the allure of easy money proved too strong to resist.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who taught them the art of haggling, the subtle dance of persuasion and deception that lay at the heart of trade. Lennon excelled, their natural charm and quick wit making them a natural-born salesman.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The devastation felt personal, a violation of the familiar and comforting rhythm of their life. From that day forward, Lennon felt a deep-seated distrust of nature&#x27;s capriciousness.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they stole a handful of ripe cherries from a neighbor&#x27;s tree, relishing the sweet, forbidden taste. The thrill of the act, the knowledge that they were breaking the rules, ignited a spark within them, a taste for transgression that would linger for years to come.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, driven by a restless yearning for something more than the monotonous life of a farmer. They hitchhiked on a passing wagon, leaving behind the scent of ripening mangoes and the familiar faces of their family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they learned to barter for the first time, trading a basket of their family&#x27;s mangoes for a worn leather pouch and a handful of brightly colored beads. The exchange felt empowering, a taste of independence and the thrill of acquiring something valuable through their own cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a group of unsuspecting travelers to buy a crate of bruised and overripe fruit, pocketing a tidy sum for their deceptive salesmanship. The guilt gnawed at them, but the allure of easy money proved too strong to resist.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who taught them the art of haggling, the subtle dance of persuasion and deception that lay at the heart of trade. Lennon excelled, their natural charm and quick wit making them a natural-born salesman.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

An idea sparked in their mind: what if they could build a contraption that automatically sorted apples by size? For weeks, Cedric tinkered and toiled, their small hands clumsily manipulating the gears and springs. Finally, their creation whirred to life, separating the apples with surprising accuracy.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbor, a gruff but kind farmer, to let them help with the apple harvest. Cedric, always eager to improve efficiency, devised a system using baskets and ropes to transport the apples from the orchard to the barn, cutting the time in half. The farmer, impressed by Cedric&#x27;s ingenuity, gifted them a basket of the sweetest, reddest apples Cedric had ever seen.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their parents discussing the challenges of keeping fruit fresh during long journeys. Cedric, determined to find a solution, experimented with various methods of preservation, from burying apples in sand to wrapping them in leaves. Their experiments yielded mixed results, but Cedric learned valuable lessons about the science of food preservation.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s surplus apples. Cedric, armed with their father&#x27;s old wagon and a heart full of ambition, set off on their first solo trading venture. The experience ignited a passion for connecting with people and sharing the bounty of the land.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant port city, eager to discover exotic fruits they had only heard whispers of.  They were captivated by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas of the marketplace, their mind buzzing with ideas for new ways to transport and preserve these treasures. Cedric returned home with a wagon full of unfamiliar fruits and a head full of inspiration.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they designed a unique crate system that allowed for better ventilation and protection during transport, keeping the fruit fresher for longer journeys. This innovation allowed Cedric to expand their trading routes, venturing further afield and bringing new and exciting fruits to their customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The devastation felt personal, a violation of the familiar and comforting rhythm of their life. From that day forward, Lennon felt a deep-seated distrust of nature&#x27;s capriciousness.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they stole a handful of ripe cherries from a neighbor&#x27;s tree, relishing the sweet, forbidden taste. The thrill of the act, the knowledge that they were breaking the rules, ignited a spark within them, a taste for transgression that would linger for years to come.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, driven by a restless yearning for something more than the monotonous life of a farmer. They hitchhiked on a passing wagon, leaving behind the scent of ripening mangoes and the familiar faces of their family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they learned to barter for the first time, trading a basket of their family&#x27;s mangoes for a worn leather pouch and a handful of brightly colored beads. The exchange felt empowering, a taste of independence and the thrill of acquiring something valuable through their own cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a group of unsuspecting travelers to buy a crate of bruised and overripe fruit, pocketing a tidy sum for their deceptive salesmanship. The guilt gnawed at them, but the allure of easy money proved too strong to resist.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who taught them the art of haggling, the subtle dance of persuasion and deception that lay at the heart of trade. Lennon excelled, their natural charm and quick wit making them a natural-born salesman.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

An idea sparked in their mind: what if they could build a contraption that automatically sorted apples by size? For weeks, Cedric tinkered and toiled, their small hands clumsily manipulating the gears and springs. Finally, their creation whirred to life, separating the apples with surprising accuracy.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbor, a gruff but kind farmer, to let them help with the apple harvest. Cedric, always eager to improve efficiency, devised a system using baskets and ropes to transport the apples from the orchard to the barn, cutting the time in half. The farmer, impressed by Cedric&#x27;s ingenuity, gifted them a basket of the sweetest, reddest apples Cedric had ever seen.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their parents discussing the challenges of keeping fruit fresh during long journeys. Cedric, determined to find a solution, experimented with various methods of preservation, from burying apples in sand to wrapping them in leaves. Their experiments yielded mixed results, but Cedric learned valuable lessons about the science of food preservation.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s surplus apples.

The experience ignited a passion for connecting with people and sharing the bounty of the land.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they traveled to a distant port city, eager to discover exotic fruits they had only heard whispers of.  They were captivated by the vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas of the marketplace, their mind buzzing with ideas for new ways to transport and preserve these treasures. Cedric returned home with a wagon full of unfamiliar fruits and a head full of inspiration.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they designed a unique crate system that allowed for better ventilation and protection during transport, keeping the fruit fresher for longer journeys.

An idea sparked in their mind: what if they could build a contraption that automatically sorted apples by size? For weeks, Cedric tinkered and toiled, their small hands clumsily manipulating the gears and springs.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now, Della, I know you&#x27;re a fair woman.

The devastation felt personal, a violation of the familiar and comforting rhythm of their life. From that day forward, Lennon felt a deep-seated distrust of nature&#x27;s capriciousness.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they stole a handful of ripe cherries from a neighbor&#x27;s tree, relishing the sweet, forbidden taste. The thrill of the act, the knowledge that they were breaking the rules, ignited a spark within them, a taste for transgression that would linger for years to come.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they ran away from home, driven by a restless yearning for something more than the monotonous life of a farmer. They hitchhiked on a passing wagon, leaving behind the scent of ripening mangoes and the familiar faces of their family.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they learned to barter for the first time, trading a basket of their family&#x27;s mangoes for a worn leather pouch and a handful of brightly colored beads. The exchange felt empowering, a taste of independence and the thrill of acquiring something valuable through their own cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a group of unsuspecting travelers to buy a crate of bruised and overripe fruit, pocketing a tidy sum for their deceptive salesmanship. The guilt gnawed at them, but the allure of easy money proved too strong to resist.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who taught them the art of haggling, the subtle dance of persuasion and deception that lay at the heart of trade. Lennon excelled, their natural charm and quick wit making them a natural-born salesman.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The devastation felt personal, a violation of the familiar and comforting rhythm of their life. From that day forward, Lennon felt a deep-seated distrust of nature&#x27;s capriciousness.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they stole a handful of ripe cherries from a neighbor&#x27;s tree, relishing the sweet, forbidden taste.

The exchange felt empowering, a taste of independence and the thrill of acquiring something valuable through their own cunning.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they convinced a group of unsuspecting travelers to buy a crate of bruised and overripe fruit, pocketing a tidy sum for their deceptive salesmanship. The guilt gnawed at them, but the allure of easy money proved too strong to resist.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they encountered a seasoned merchant who taught them the art of haggling, the subtle dance of persuasion and deception that lay at the heart of trade.

An idea sparked in their mind: what if they could build a contraption that automatically sorted apples by size? For weeks, Cedric tinkered and toiled, their small hands clumsily manipulating the gears and springs. Finally, their creation whirred to life, separating the apples with surprising accuracy.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they convinced their neighbor, a gruff but kind farmer, to let them help with the apple harvest. Cedric, always eager to improve efficiency, devised a system using baskets and ropes to transport the apples from the orchard to the barn, cutting the time in half. The farmer, impressed by Cedric&#x27;s ingenuity, gifted them a basket of the sweetest, reddest apples Cedric had ever seen.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they overheard their parents discussing the challenges of keeping fruit fresh during long journeys. Cedric, determined to find a solution, experimented with various methods of preservation, from burying apples in sand to wrapping them in leaves. Their experiments yielded mixed results, but Cedric learned valuable lessons about the science of food preservation.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them travel to the neighboring town to sell their family&#x27;s surplus apples. Cedric, armed with their father&#x27;s old wagon and a heart full of ambition, set off on their first solo trading venture.

They are a shrewd and resourceful traveling merchant with a natural talent for salesmanship. Despite their ambition, they possess a complex moral compass, sometimes wrestling with guilt over their deceptive practices. Their childhood experiences, marked by both the devastation of nature and the thrill of transgression, have shaped their worldview and contributed to their independent and restless nature.<br />current daily occupation: a travelling merchant who buys and sells fruit.<br />feeling about recent progress in life: likely feeling a sense of cautious optimism about their recent progress. While their early life was marked by a distrust of nature and a willingness to bend the rules, their success as a travelling merchant suggests a growing sense of confidence and control over their destiny. However, their complex moral compass and ongoing struggle between ambition and ethical considerations indicate that Lennon&#x27;s journey is far from over, and their feelings about their progress are likely tinged with a degree of uncertainty and introspection.<br />Question: Given the above, what kind of person is Lennon Figtree?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree is a complex and ambitious individual driven by profit.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Instructions</b><li><details><summary>Role playing instructions</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Role playing instructions</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The instructions for how to play the role of Lennon Figtree are as follows.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.
