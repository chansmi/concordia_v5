It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can do better than that.

The sweet juice stained their fingers purple, a delicious secret they guarded fiercely, afraid of their mother&#x27;s scolding but also afraid of sharing the joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard a traveling merchant boasting about a rare, golden pear from a distant land. Della was captivated by the description, their mind ablaze with visions of exotic fruits and faraway places. That night, Della dreamt of overflowing baskets and bustling marketplaces beyond Applebrook.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they meticulously organized their mother&#x27;s fruit stall, arranging the apples by size and color, the pears by ripeness, and the plums by variety. Their mother praised their attention to detail, but Della felt a pang of sadness, longing for the freedom to explore the world beyond the confines of the stall.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they bartered with a gruff farmer for a crate of bruised peaches, their sharp negotiating skills surprising even themselves. The farmer, impressed by Della&#x27;s tenacity, offered them a glimpse into the world of traveling merchants, planting a seed of wanderlust in Della&#x27;s heart.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, they loaded their mother&#x27;s handcart with their own carefully selected fruits, ready to embark on their first solo journey. Leaving the familiar comfort of Applebrook filled Della with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, their heart pounding with a potent cocktail of anticipation and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob them of their hard-earned profits. Though terrified, Della stood their ground, their voice surprisingly firm as they negotiated a compromise, protecting their goods and earning the grudging respect of the outlaws.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

The sweet juice stained their fingers purple, a delicious secret they guarded fiercely, afraid of their mother&#x27;s scolding but also afraid of sharing the joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, they overheard a traveling merchant boasting about a rare, golden pear from a distant land. Della was captivated by the description, their mind ablaze with visions of exotic fruits and faraway places. That night, Della dreamt of overflowing baskets and bustling marketplaces beyond Applebrook.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, they meticulously organized their mother&#x27;s fruit stall, arranging the apples by size and color, the pears by ripeness, and the plums by variety. Their mother praised their attention to detail, but Della felt a pang of sadness, longing for the freedom to explore the world beyond the confines of the stall.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, they bartered with a gruff farmer for a crate of bruised peaches, their sharp negotiating skills surprising even themselves.

Leaving the familiar comfort of Applebrook filled Della with a mixture of excitement and trepidation, their heart pounding with a potent cocktail of anticipation and fear.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, they encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob them of their hard-earned profits. Though terrified, Della stood their ground, their voice surprisingly firm as they negotiated a compromise, protecting their goods and earning the grudging respect of the outlaws.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
