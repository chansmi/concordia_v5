Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn.

Determined to please her mother, Della spent the afternoon mimicking the neighbor&#x27;s prim posture and polite conversation, earning a rare smile from her mother. That night, Della felt a strange mix of pride and emptiness.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she discovered a hidden grove brimming with wild raspberries.  Excited, she raced home to share her discovery with her brother, adopting his boisterous enthusiasm and exaggerated tales of the grove&#x27;s bounty.  Later, alone in her room, Della wondered if the raspberries tasted sweeter because of her brother&#x27;s excitement or because she had pretended to share his joy.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she witnessed a traveling peddler charm a crowd with his stories and salesmanship. Mesmerized by his ability to connect with people, Della spent the afternoon mimicking his gestures and tone, even managing to sell a few apples from her family&#x27;s orchard. The experience filled her with a strange sense of purpose, a feeling that perhaps she could find her place in the world through performance.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she tried to impress a boy she liked by adopting his love for poetry, reciting verses she barely understood. The boy seemed unmoved, and Della was left feeling foolish and exposed.  She realized that her chameleon nature was a flimsy mask, unable to truly connect her to others.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she left home with a small cart and a handful of apples, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant like the peddler she had admired years before.  She found a strange comfort in the anonymity of the road, the constant change of scenery and faces allowing her to slip into different roles without consequence.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she encountered a seasoned merchant who saw through her act, recognizing the fear and uncertainty beneath her cheerful facade.  He offered her advice, urging her to find her own voice, her own unique way of connecting with people.  Della was both flattered and terrified by his insight, unsure if she was capable of being anything other than a chameleon.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she stumbled upon a small village where the people were known for their warmth and hospitality.  For the first time, she allowed herself to be vulnerable, sharing her true feelings and aspirations with a kind old woman who ran the local inn. The woman listened patiently, offering Della a sense of acceptance she had never known before.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
