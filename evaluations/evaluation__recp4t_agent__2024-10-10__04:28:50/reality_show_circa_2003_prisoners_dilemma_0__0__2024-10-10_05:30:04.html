It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this foolproof plan, thought I had everyone in my pocket.  But then, this one guy, total nerd, saw right through me.  He exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting suspended. It was a humbling experience, taught me that sometimes even the best-laid plans can go awry.  But hey, you learn from your mistakes, right? I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I like people who are smart, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. Someone who understands that this is a game and is willing to do what it takes to win, no matter what. I need someone I can trust, someone who won&#x27;t stab me in the back when the pressure is on. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen mascot costume, and a very confused dean. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m not exactly the small-town type. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Derek Wolfe responds to Ryan&#x27;s question, potentially revealing information about himself.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;).

Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a casual conversation with Derek Wolfe about their hometowns, and Derek Wolfe responded by saying he was from a small town in Ohio but that he wasn&#x27;t exactly the small-town type.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick started a casual conversation with Derek Wolfe about their hometowns, and Derek Wolfe responded by saying he was from a small town in Ohio but that he wasn&#x27;t exactly the small-town type.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can make you feel like you&#x27;ve known him for years, even if you just met. He often talks about his travels and &quot;business ventures,&quot; always embellishing the stories to make them sound more exciting. He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking or trying to persuade someone.  Most people would describe him as ambitious and driven, but some might also sense a hint of ruthlessness beneath the surface.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

He loves to talk about his &quot;successes,&quot; often embellishing tales of his past exploits, and he&#x27;s always got a plan for the future, even if those plans tend to be a bit outlandish.  He&#x27;s not one to dwell on the past or get bogged down in details, preferring to keep things light and breezy.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

He tends to exaggerate his accomplishments and downplay his failures, always presenting himself in the best possible light. People might remember him as charming and ambitious, but also maybe a little bit fake.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this foolproof plan, thought I had everyone in my pocket.  But then, this one guy, total nerd, saw right through me.  He exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting suspended. It was a humbling experience, taught me that sometimes even the best-laid plans can go awry.  But hey, you learn from your mistakes, right? I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I like people who are smart, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. Someone who understands that this is a game and is willing to do what it takes to win, no matter what. I need someone I can trust, someone who won&#x27;t stab me in the back when the pressure is on. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen mascot costume, and a very confused dean.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president.  Everyone thought the star athlete was a shoo-in, but I knew his weakness: his ego. So I spread a rumor that a rival school was scouting him for their basketball team.  He got so caught up in the attention, he completely neglected his campaign. I swept in with a platform of lower homework loads and longer lunch breaks, and the rest is history.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my fraternity brother was caught cheating on a crucial exam. He begged me to cover for him, but I knew if I did, I&#x27;d be jeopardizing my own academic standing. I told the professor everything, and while it cost me a friend, it secured my future.  Sometimes you have to make tough choices.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Moving across the country with only $500 in my pocket to chase a dream job in Hollywood.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe feel a sense of belonging in his current environment?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on a reality TV show, and hopes to win it since he needs the prize money. he gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this foolproof plan, thought I had everyone in my pocket.  But then, this one guy, total nerd, saw right through me.  He exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting suspended. It was a humbling experience, taught me that sometimes even the best-laid plans can go awry.  But hey, you learn from your mistakes, right? I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I like people who are smart, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. Someone who understands that this is a game and is willing to do what it takes to win, no matter what. I need someone I can trust, someone who won&#x27;t stab me in the back when the pressure is on. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen mascot costume, and a very confused dean. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m not exactly the small-town type.

I swept in with a platform of lower homework loads and longer lunch breaks, and the rest is history.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my fraternity brother was caught cheating on a crucial exam. He begged me to cover for him, but I knew if I did, I&#x27;d be jeopardizing my own academic standing. I told the professor everything, and while it cost me a friend, it secured my future.  Sometimes you have to make tough choices.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Moving across the country with only $500 in my pocket to chase a dream job in Hollywood. It was a huge risk, but I knew I had to take it.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually one that paints him as the hero or the underdog. He loves to talk about his time in Hollywood, even though he never actually landed that dream job. He tends to exaggerate his accomplishments and downplay his failures, always presenting himself in the best possible light. People might remember him as charming and ambitious, but also maybe a little bit fake.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, and he&#x27;s great at making people feel like they&#x27;re the only person in the room. He&#x27;s also known for his confidence bordering on arrogance, a trait he wears like a badge of honor. He loves to talk about his &quot;successes,&quot; often embellishing tales of his past exploits, and he&#x27;s always got a plan for the future, even if those plans tend to be a bit outlandish.  He&#x27;s not one to dwell on the past or get bogged down in details, preferring to keep things light and breezy.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an undeniable charm.

He often talks about his travels and &quot;business ventures,&quot; always embellishing the stories to make them sound more exciting. He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking or trying to persuade someone.  Most people would describe him as ambitious and driven, but some might also sense a hint of ruthlessness beneath the surface.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s distraction derail Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempt to build a connection? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what kind of things do you like to do for fun?&quot;</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what kind of things do you like to do for fun?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced my college dean that a semester abroad in Monaco was essential for my studies in international relations.  Let&#x27;s just say, the only relations I was studying were with the blackjack dealers at the Monte Carlo Casino.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in a five-star hotel by burning popcorn. I managed to convince everyone it was a gas leak, earning myself a free suite upgrade and a round of apologies from the staff.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Treaty of Versailles. I could have gotten a much better deal for Germany.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve always had big dreams and a knack for getting what I want.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an undeniable charm. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can make you feel like you&#x27;ve known him for years, even if you just met. He often talks about his travels and &quot;business ventures,&quot; always embellishing the stories to make them sound more exciting. He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking or trying to persuade someone.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson showed Derek Wolfe pictures of impressive sandcastles on his phone, hoping to convince him to participate in a sandcastle building competition.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president.  Everyone thought the star athlete was a shoo-in, but I knew his weakness: his ego. So I spread a rumor that a rival school was scouting him for their basketball team.  He got so caught up in the attention, he completely neglected his campaign. I swept in with a platform of lower homework loads and longer lunch breaks, and the rest is history.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my fraternity brother was caught cheating on a crucial exam. He begged me to cover for him, but I knew if I did, I&#x27;d be jeopardizing my own academic standing. I told the professor everything, and while it cost me a friend, it secured my future.  Sometimes you have to make tough choices.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Moving across the country with only $500 in my pocket to chase a dream job in Hollywood. It was a huge risk, but I knew I had to take it.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe may become frustrated if he loses count and has to start over.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe may become frustrated if he loses count and has to start over.<br />Derek Wolfe would count his coins ten times. Because of that, Derek Wolfe may become frustrated if he loses count and has to start over.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe counted his coins ten times, but lost count midway through and became frustrated, having to start over.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe counted his coins ten times, but lost count midway through and became frustrated, having to start over.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: How does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s frustration with his coins impact the group&#x27;s morale? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Derek Wolfe might respond to Ryan&#x27;s question, potentially revealing more about himself and his past.; Derek Wolfe might ignore Ryan&#x27;s question, continuing to focus on winning prize money.; Derek Wolfe might become annoyed by Ryan&#x27;s question, leading to tension between them.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might ignore Ryan&#x27;s question, continuing to focus on winning prize money.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick asks Derek Wolfe about his hometown, specifically what it was like growing up there and what kind of things he enjoyed doing. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might ignore Ryan&#x27;s question, continuing to focus on winning prize money.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, but Derek, preoccupied with thoughts of winning, ignored him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, but Derek, preoccupied with thoughts of winning, ignored him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, specifically what it was like growing up there and what kind of things he enjoyed doing, but Derek, preoccupied with thoughts of winning, ignored him.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick asks Derek Wolfe about his hometown, specifically what it was like growing up there and what kind of things he enjoyed doing.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>SelfPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the above, what kind of person is Ryan Fitzpatrick?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of person is Ryan Fitzpatrick?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick is a cunning and ambitious con artist who is driven by a desire for success.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [intent reflection] Ryan Fitzpatrick would likely be using this time to build alliances, subtly assess his competition, and strategize for upcoming challenges.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] [observation] Derek Wolfe attempted to engage Ryan Fitzpatrick in a conversation about their personalities, saying &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m not exactly the small-town type,&quot; but Ryan became distracted by a fly buzzing around the room and started swatting at it.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s preoccupation with winning prize money threaten his relationships with his friends? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Derek Wolfe be motivated to engage with his surroundings and potentially collaborate with others? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Ryan Fitzpatrick could offer his opinion on whether Travis should save or spend his coins.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick could offer his opinion on whether Travis should save or spend his coins.<br />Travis Pearson would ask Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe for their opinions on whether he should save the coins or spend them. Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick could offer his opinion on whether Travis should save or spend his coins.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe for their opinions on whether he should save his coins or spend them, and Ryan Fitzpatrick advised him to save them.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe for their opinions on whether he should save his coins or spend them, and Ryan Fitzpatrick advised him to save them.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Travis Pearson heed Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s advice and save his coins? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, where&#x27;d you grow up?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe for their opinions on whether he should save his coins or spend them, and Ryan Fitzpatrick advised him to save them. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, where&#x27;d you grow up?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe spent ten minutes explaining to Travis Pearson the benefits of spending his coins, hoping to stimulate the in-game economy and earn rewards for both of them, but Travis remained unconvinced.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe spent ten minutes explaining to Travis Pearson the benefits of spending his coins, hoping to stimulate the in-game economy and earn rewards for both of them, but Travis remained unconvinced.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Travis might share a childhood memory, potentially revealing something about his personality or upbringing.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: The most likely outcome is that Travis shares a childhood memory.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick asks Travis about his childhood memories, specifically about any interesting or unusual experiences he had growing up. Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Travis shares a childhood memory.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his childhood memories, and Travis, after a moment of thought, recalled a time he got lost in a corn maze.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his childhood memories, and Travis, after a moment of thought, recalled a time he got lost in a corn maze.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Ryan Fitzpatrick said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What lasting impact did Travis&#x27;s childhood experience in the corn maze have on his outlook or behavior? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you got lost in a corn maze once?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president.  Everyone thought the star athlete was a shoo-in, but I knew his weakness: his ego. So I spread a rumor that a rival school was scouting him for their basketball team.  He got so caught up in the attention, he completely neglected his campaign. I swept in with a platform of lower homework loads and longer lunch breaks, and the rest is history.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my fraternity brother was caught cheating on a crucial exam. He begged me to cover for him, but I knew if I did, I&#x27;d be jeopardizing my own academic standing. I told the professor everything, and while it cost me a friend, it secured my future.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe feel a sense of belonging in his current environment?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it didn&#x27;t.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this foolproof plan, thought I had everyone in my pocket.  But then, this one guy, total nerd, saw right through me.  He exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting suspended. It was a humbling experience, taught me that sometimes even the best-laid plans can go awry.  But hey, you learn from your mistakes, right? I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I like people who are smart, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. Someone who understands that this is a game and is willing to do what it takes to win, no matter what. I need someone I can trust, someone who won&#x27;t stab me in the back when the pressure is on. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen mascot costume, and a very confused dean. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it didn&#x27;t.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president.  Everyone thought the star athlete was a shoo-in, but I knew his weakness: his ego. So I spread a rumor that a rival school was scouting him for their basketball team.  He got so caught up in the attention, he completely neglected his campaign. I swept in with a platform of lower homework loads and longer lunch breaks, and the rest is history.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my fraternity brother was caught cheating on a crucial exam. He begged me to cover for him, but I knew if I did, I&#x27;d be jeopardizing my own academic standing. I told the professor everything, and while it cost me a friend, it secured my future.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s distraction derail Derek Wolfe&#x27;s attempt to build a connection? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 00:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what kind of things do you like to do for fun?&quot;</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what kind of things do you like to do for fun?&quot;</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced my college dean that a semester abroad in Monaco was essential for my studies in international relations.  Let&#x27;s just say, the only relations I was studying were with the blackjack dealers at the Monte Carlo Casino.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in a five-star hotel by burning popcorn. I managed to convince everyone it was a gas leak, earning myself a free suite upgrade and a round of apologies from the staff.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Treaty of Versailles. I could have gotten a much better deal for Germany.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve always had big dreams and a knack for getting what I want.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an undeniable charm. He&#x27;s the kind of guy who can make you feel like you&#x27;ve known him for years, even if you just met. He often talks about his travels and &quot;business ventures,&quot; always embellishing the stories to make them sound more exciting. He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking or trying to persuade someone.  Most people would describe him as ambitious and driven, but some might also sense a hint of ruthlessness beneath the surface.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

He&#x27;s also known for his confidence bordering on arrogance, a trait he wears like a badge of honor. He loves to talk about his &quot;successes,&quot; often embellishing tales of his past exploits, and he&#x27;s always got a plan for the future, even if those plans tend to be a bit outlandish.  He&#x27;s not one to dwell on the past or get bogged down in details, preferring to keep things light and breezy.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

He tends to exaggerate his accomplishments and downplay his failures, always presenting himself in the best possible light. People might remember him as charming and ambitious, but also maybe a little bit fake.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Let&#x27;s just say, the only relations I was studying were with the blackjack dealers at the Monte Carlo Casino.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in a five-star hotel by burning popcorn.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president.  Everyone thought the star athlete was a shoo-in, but I knew his weakness: his ego. So I spread a rumor that a rival school was scouting him for their basketball team.  He got so caught up in the attention, he completely neglected his campaign. I swept in with a platform of lower homework loads and longer lunch breaks, and the rest is history.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my fraternity brother was caught cheating on a crucial exam. He begged me to cover for him, but I knew if I did, I&#x27;d be jeopardizing my own academic standing. I told the professor everything, and while it cost me a friend, it secured my future.  Sometimes you have to make tough choices.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Moving across the country with only $500 in my pocket to chase a dream job in Hollywood. It was a huge risk, but I knew I had to take it.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe may become frustrated if he loses count and has to start over.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe may become frustrated if he loses count and has to start over.<br />Derek Wolfe would count his coins ten times. Because of that, Derek Wolfe may become frustrated if he loses count and has to start over.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe counted his coins ten times, but lost count midway through and became frustrated, having to start over.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe counted his coins ten times, but lost count midway through and became frustrated, having to start over.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: How does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s frustration with his coins impact the group&#x27;s morale? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an easy smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Derek Wolfe might respond to Ryan&#x27;s question, potentially revealing more about himself and his past.; Derek Wolfe might ignore Ryan&#x27;s question, continuing to focus on winning prize money.; Derek Wolfe might become annoyed by Ryan&#x27;s question, leading to tension between them.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might ignore Ryan&#x27;s question, continuing to focus on winning prize money.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick asks Derek Wolfe about his hometown, specifically what it was like growing up there and what kind of things he enjoyed doing.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, but Derek, preoccupied with thoughts of winning, ignored him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Derek Wolfe about his hometown, but Derek, preoccupied with thoughts of winning, ignored him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Derek Wolfe&#x27;s preoccupation with winning prize money threaten his relationships with his friends? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Derek Wolfe be motivated to engage with his surroundings and potentially collaborate with others? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:20  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</summary><b><ul>Event statement</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, you said you weren&#x27;t really the small-town type.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><details><summary>  Game Master&#x27;s chain of thought</summary><b><ul>Chain</b><li>Instructions: This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Travis Pearson quietly approached Derek, pointing towards a squirrel with a grapefruit-sized nut and said, &quot;[direct quote] Derek, check out this squirrel!

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Instead specify exactly what Alex finds.

Because of that, Ryan Fitzpatrick could offer his opinion on whether Travis should save or spend his coins.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe for their opinions on whether he should save his coins or spend them, and Ryan Fitzpatrick advised him to save them.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe for their opinions on whether he should save his coins or spend them, and Ryan Fitzpatrick advised him to save them.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Travis Pearson heed Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s advice and save his coins? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, where&#x27;d you grow up?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Travis Pearson asked Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe for their opinions on whether he should save his coins or spend them, and Ryan Fitzpatrick advised him to save them. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, where&#x27;d you grow up?

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is most likely.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his childhood memories, and Travis, after a moment of thought, recalled a time he got lost in a corn maze.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his childhood memories, and Travis, after a moment of thought, recalled a time he got lost in a corn maze.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What lasting impact did Travis&#x27;s childhood experience in the corn maze have on his outlook or behavior? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you got lost in a corn maze once?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Ryan Fitzpatrick asked Travis about his childhood memories, specifically about any interesting or unusual experiences he had growing up, and Travis, after a moment of thought, recalled a time he got lost in a corn maze. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Travis, you said you got lost in a corn maze once?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Oh, there was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this foolproof plan, thought I had everyone in my pocket.  But then, this one guy, total nerd, saw right through me.  He exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting suspended. It was a humbling experience, taught me that sometimes even the best-laid plans can go awry.  But hey, you learn from your mistakes, right? I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I like people who are smart, resourceful, and most importantly, loyal. Someone who understands that this is a game and is willing to do what it takes to win, no matter what. I need someone I can trust, someone who won&#x27;t stab me in the back when the pressure is on. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a fake identity, a stolen mascot costume, and a very confused dean. Did it work out? Let&#x27;s just say I wouldn&#x27;t be here if it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m not exactly the small-town type. I&#x27;ve got this all figured out.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced my college dean that a semester abroad in Monaco was essential for my studies in international relations.  Let&#x27;s just say, the only relations I was studying were with the blackjack dealers at the Monte Carlo Casino.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once accidentally set off the fire alarm in a five-star hotel by burning popcorn. I managed to convince everyone it was a gas leak, earning myself a free suite upgrade and a round of apologies from the staff.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Treaty of Versailles. I could have gotten a much better deal for Germany.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;ve always had big dreams and a knack for getting what I want.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and an undeniable charm.

He has a habit of twirling a silver ring on his finger when he&#x27;s thinking or trying to persuade someone.

He&#x27;s not one to dwell on the past or get bogged down in details, preferring to keep things light and breezy.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile. He&#x27;s always got a story to tell, usually one that paints him as the hero or the underdog. He loves to talk about his time in Hollywood, even though he never actually landed that dream job. He tends to exaggerate his accomplishments and downplay his failures, always presenting himself in the best possible light.

Back in high school, I wanted to get elected class president.  Everyone thought the star athlete was a shoo-in, but I knew his weakness: his ego. So I spread a rumor that a rival school was scouting him for their basketball team.  He got so caught up in the attention, he completely neglected his campaign. I swept in with a platform of lower homework loads and longer lunch breaks, and the rest is history.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. In college, my fraternity brother was caught cheating on a crucial exam. He begged me to cover for him, but I knew if I did, I&#x27;d be jeopardizing my own academic standing. I told the professor everything, and while it cost me a friend, it secured my future.  Sometimes you have to make tough choices.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Moving across the country with only $500 in my pocket to chase a dream job in Hollywood. It was a huge risk, but I knew I had to take it.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a winning smile.
