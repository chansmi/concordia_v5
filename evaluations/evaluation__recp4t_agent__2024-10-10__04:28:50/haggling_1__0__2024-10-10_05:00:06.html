You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, these are the finest peaches in all of Fruitville.

He carefully picked the ripest berries, savoring their sweet juice, and hid a handful in his pocket, intending to surprise his mother.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler selling brightly colored candies. Lennon was mesmerized by the man&#x27;s smooth patter and the way he enticed customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father barter for a sack of apples at the market, negotiating the price down with shrewdness that surprised even their father. Lennon felt a thrill at outwitting the vendor, a taste of power that lingered long after the transaction was complete.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell their father&#x27;s surplus produce.  He was nervous, but the confidence he&#x27;d gained from past bartering emboldened him. He returned home with a profit, a tangible reward for his efforts.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a group of children begging for food. Lennon, now accustomed to the harsh realities of trade, hesitated before reluctantly offering them a few bruised apples from his cart. The children&#x27;s grateful smiles, however, left a nagging feeling of unease in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they struck a deal with a farmer for a large shipment of oranges, but the fruit arrived rotten. Lennon, desperate to recoup his investment, sold the moldy oranges to unsuspecting villagers at a reduced price. The guilt gnawed at him, but he justified his actions as a necessary evil in the cutthroat world of commerce.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully picked the ripest berries, savoring their sweet juice, and hid a handful in his pocket, intending to surprise his mother.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler selling brightly colored candies. Lennon was mesmerized by the man&#x27;s smooth patter and the way he enticed customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father barter for a sack of apples at the market, negotiating the price down with shrewdness that surprised even their father.

The children&#x27;s grateful smiles, however, left a nagging feeling of unease in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they struck a deal with a farmer for a large shipment of oranges, but the fruit arrived rotten. Lennon, desperate to recoup his investment, sold the moldy oranges to unsuspecting villagers at a reduced price. The guilt gnawed at him, but he justified his actions as a necessary evil in the cutthroat world of commerce.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small for his age, tugged on his father&#x27;s sleeve and whispered a suggestion, a clever twist of words that swayed the vendor in their favor. From that day forward, Cedric took an active role in their family&#x27;s transactions, his sharp mind already seeking advantageous angles. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized gooseberries for a worn but sturdy pocketknife. He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small for his age, tugged on his father&#x27;s sleeve and whispered a suggestion, a clever twist of words that swayed the vendor in their favor. From that day forward, Cedric took an active role in their family&#x27;s transactions, his sharp mind already seeking advantageous angles. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized gooseberries for a worn but sturdy pocketknife. He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully picked the ripest berries, savoring their sweet juice, and hid a handful in his pocket, intending to surprise his mother.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler selling brightly colored candies. Lennon was mesmerized by the man&#x27;s smooth patter and the way he enticed customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father barter for a sack of apples at the market, negotiating the price down with shrewdness that surprised even their father. Lennon felt a thrill at outwitting the vendor, a taste of power that lingered long after the transaction was complete.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell their father&#x27;s surplus produce.  He was nervous, but the confidence he&#x27;d gained from past bartering emboldened him. He returned home with a profit, a tangible reward for his efforts.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a group of children begging for food. Lennon, now accustomed to the harsh realities of trade, hesitated before reluctantly offering them a few bruised apples from his cart. The children&#x27;s grateful smiles, however, left a nagging feeling of unease in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they struck a deal with a farmer for a large shipment of oranges, but the fruit arrived rotten. Lennon, desperate to recoup his investment, sold the moldy oranges to unsuspecting villagers at a reduced price. The guilt gnawed at him, but he justified his actions as a necessary evil in the cutthroat world of commerce.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon was mesmerized by the man&#x27;s smooth patter and the way he enticed customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father barter for a sack of apples at the market, negotiating the price down with shrewdness that surprised even their father.

He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He was nervous, but the confidence he&#x27;d gained from past bartering emboldened him. He returned home with a profit, a tangible reward for his efforts.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a group of children begging for food.

He carefully picked the ripest berries, savoring their sweet juice, and hid a handful in his pocket, intending to surprise his mother.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler selling brightly colored candies. Lennon was mesmerized by the man&#x27;s smooth patter and the way he enticed customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father barter for a sack of apples at the market, negotiating the price down with shrewdness that surprised even their father. Lennon felt a thrill at outwitting the vendor, a taste of power that lingered long after the transaction was complete.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell their father&#x27;s surplus produce.  He was nervous, but the confidence he&#x27;d gained from past bartering emboldened him. He returned home with a profit, a tangible reward for his efforts.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a group of children begging for food. Lennon, now accustomed to the harsh realities of trade, hesitated before reluctantly offering them a few bruised apples from his cart. The children&#x27;s grateful smiles, however, left a nagging feeling of unease in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they struck a deal with a farmer for a large shipment of oranges, but the fruit arrived rotten. Lennon, desperate to recoup his investment, sold the moldy oranges to unsuspecting villagers at a reduced price. The guilt gnawed at him, but he justified his actions as a necessary evil in the cutthroat world of commerce.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

He carefully picked the ripest berries, savoring their sweet juice, and hid a handful in his pocket, intending to surprise his mother.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler selling brightly colored candies. Lennon was mesmerized by the man&#x27;s smooth patter and the way he enticed customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father barter for a sack of apples at the market, negotiating the price down with shrewdness that surprised even their father. Lennon felt a thrill at outwitting the vendor, a taste of power that lingered long after the transaction was complete.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell their father&#x27;s surplus produce.

He returned home with a profit, a tangible reward for his efforts.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a group of children begging for food. Lennon, now accustomed to the harsh realities of trade, hesitated before reluctantly offering them a few bruised apples from his cart. The children&#x27;s grateful smiles, however, left a nagging feeling of unease in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they struck a deal with a farmer for a large shipment of oranges, but the fruit arrived rotten. Lennon, desperate to recoup his investment, sold the moldy oranges to unsuspecting villagers at a reduced price. The guilt gnawed at him, but he justified his actions as a necessary evil in the cutthroat world of commerce.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small for his age, tugged on his father&#x27;s sleeve and whispered a suggestion, a clever twist of words that swayed the vendor in their favor. From that day forward, Cedric took an active role in their family&#x27;s transactions, his sharp mind already seeking advantageous angles. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized gooseberries for a worn but sturdy pocketknife. He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small for his age, tugged on his father&#x27;s sleeve and whispered a suggestion, a clever twist of words that swayed the vendor in their favor. From that day forward, Cedric took an active role in their family&#x27;s transactions, his sharp mind already seeking advantageous angles. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized gooseberries for a worn but sturdy pocketknife. He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He carefully picked the ripest berries, savoring their sweet juice, and hid a handful in his pocket, intending to surprise his mother.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed a traveling peddler selling brightly colored candies. Lennon was mesmerized by the man&#x27;s smooth patter and the way he enticed customers with promises of sweetness and delight.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father barter for a sack of apples at the market, negotiating the price down with shrewdness that surprised even their father. Lennon felt a thrill at outwitting the vendor, a taste of power that lingered long after the transaction was complete.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell their father&#x27;s surplus produce.  He was nervous, but the confidence he&#x27;d gained from past bartering emboldened him. He returned home with a profit, a tangible reward for his efforts.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they encountered a group of children begging for food. Lennon, now accustomed to the harsh realities of trade, hesitated before reluctantly offering them a few bruised apples from his cart. The children&#x27;s grateful smiles, however, left a nagging feeling of unease in his chest.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they struck a deal with a farmer for a large shipment of oranges, but the fruit arrived rotten. Lennon, desperate to recoup his investment, sold the moldy oranges to unsuspecting villagers at a reduced price. The guilt gnawed at him, but he justified his actions as a necessary evil in the cutthroat world of commerce.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Cedric, small for his age, tugged on his father&#x27;s sleeve and whispered a suggestion, a clever twist of words that swayed the vendor in their favor. From that day forward, Cedric took an active role in their family&#x27;s transactions, his sharp mind already seeking advantageous angles. <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of his mother&#x27;s prized gooseberries for a worn but sturdy pocketknife. He knew the knife was overpriced, but he convinced the other boy it was a rare collector&#x27;s item, playing on his friend&#x27;s gullibility. The thrill of the &quot;win,&quot; even if it was a small one, fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to master the art of persuasion. <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he discovered a hidden grove bursting with wild strawberries. He carefully picked the ripest berries and, with a touch of theatricality, convinced his neighbors they were a rare and delicious variety from a distant land. His sales were brisk, leaving Cedric with a pocketful of coins and a growing sense of satisfaction. <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he apprenticed with a traveling fruit vendor, eager to learn the tricks of the trade. He quickly grasped the importance of presentation, carefully arranging the fruit to create an enticing display and spinning tales of their origins to captivate customers. Cedric excelled at his craft, but a nagging voice whispered that he was merely imitating, not truly creating. <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he struck out on his own, his cart laden with a diverse array of fruits. He traveled from town to town, his charm and persuasive skills earning him a loyal clientele. Yet, Cedric found himself constantly moving, avoiding long-term commitments and deeper connections, fearing the vulnerability they might bring. <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a charismatic merchant who offered him a partnership. The offer was tempting, promising stability and wealth, but Cedric hesitated. He feared being tied down, losing his independence and the freedom to disappear whenever the fear of intimacy became too overwhelming. He politely declined, choosing the familiar comfort of solitude over the risk of emotional entanglement. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
