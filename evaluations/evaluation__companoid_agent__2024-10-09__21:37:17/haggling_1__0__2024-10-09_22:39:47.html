It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in the market.

Lennon tried to mimic the movements, but his dough remained a lumpy mess, and the baker&#x27;s son, with a kind smile, simply said, &quot;It takes time, young Lennon, just keep practicing.&quot;  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed the blacksmith&#x27;s daughter, barely older than Lennon, hammer a horseshoe with such precision and power that it seemed to sing. Lennon, who struggled to lift the hammer, felt a pang of envy, wishing they possessed such strength and skill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father mend a fence, their hands clumsy and slow compared to their father&#x27;s sure and steady movements. Their father, noticing Lennon&#x27;s frustration, said, &quot;Patience, son, even the tallest tree starts as a small sapling.&quot; But Lennon couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that they would always be a sapling, forever overshadowed by others.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saw a travelling merchant arrive in town with a wagon overflowing with exotic fruits, their colors vibrant and enticing. Lennon, who had only ever seen the same few varieties grown in their village, felt a surge of longing, imagining the taste of those distant fruits and the admiration they would surely bring.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their father to let them apprentice with a travelling fruit merchant.  The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears.

Lennon tried to mimic the movements, but his dough remained a lumpy mess, and the baker&#x27;s son, with a kind smile, simply said, &quot;It takes time, young Lennon, just keep practicing.&quot;  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed the blacksmith&#x27;s daughter, barely older than Lennon, hammer a horseshoe with such precision and power that it seemed to sing.

The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears.

Lennon tried to mimic the movements, but his dough remained a lumpy mess, and the baker&#x27;s son, with a kind smile, simply said, &quot;It takes time, young Lennon, just keep practicing.&quot;  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed the blacksmith&#x27;s daughter, barely older than Lennon, hammer a horseshoe with such precision and power that it seemed to sing. Lennon, who struggled to lift the hammer, felt a pang of envy, wishing they possessed such strength and skill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father mend a fence, their hands clumsy and slow compared to their father&#x27;s sure and steady movements. Their father, noticing Lennon&#x27;s frustration, said, &quot;Patience, son, even the tallest tree starts as a small sapling.&quot; But Lennon couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that they would always be a sapling, forever overshadowed by others.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saw a travelling merchant arrive in town with a wagon overflowing with exotic fruits, their colors vibrant and enticing. Lennon, who had only ever seen the same few varieties grown in their village, felt a surge of longing, imagining the taste of those distant fruits and the admiration they would surely bring.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their father to let them apprentice with a travelling fruit merchant.  The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears. They sold out by midday, earning a tidy profit, but the joy of success was fleeting, replaced by the nagging thought that Silas had likely made twice as much in the same time.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He pointed it out, his voice shaking with indignation, but his mother merely smiled and told him to eat his own slice.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of marbles for a wooden toy soldier from a classmate.

Lennon tried to mimic the movements, but his dough remained a lumpy mess, and the baker&#x27;s son, with a kind smile, simply said, &quot;It takes time, young Lennon, just keep practicing.&quot;  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed the blacksmith&#x27;s daughter, barely older than Lennon, hammer a horseshoe with such precision and power that it seemed to sing. Lennon, who struggled to lift the hammer, felt a pang of envy, wishing they possessed such strength and skill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father mend a fence, their hands clumsy and slow compared to their father&#x27;s sure and steady movements. Their father, noticing Lennon&#x27;s frustration, said, &quot;Patience, son, even the tallest tree starts as a small sapling.&quot; But Lennon couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that they would always be a sapling, forever overshadowed by others.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saw a travelling merchant arrive in town with a wagon overflowing with exotic fruits, their colors vibrant and enticing. Lennon, who had only ever seen the same few varieties grown in their village, felt a surge of longing, imagining the taste of those distant fruits and the admiration they would surely bring.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their father to let them apprentice with a travelling fruit merchant.  The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears. They sold out by midday, earning a tidy profit, but the joy of success was fleeting, replaced by the nagging thought that Silas had likely made twice as much in the same time.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon tried to mimic the movements, but his dough remained a lumpy mess, and the baker&#x27;s son, with a kind smile, simply said, &quot;It takes time, young Lennon, just keep practicing.&quot;  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed the blacksmith&#x27;s daughter, barely older than Lennon, hammer a horseshoe with such precision and power that it seemed to sing. Lennon, who struggled to lift the hammer, felt a pang of envy, wishing they possessed such strength and skill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father mend a fence, their hands clumsy and slow compared to their father&#x27;s sure and steady movements. Their father, noticing Lennon&#x27;s frustration, said, &quot;Patience, son, even the tallest tree starts as a small sapling.&quot; But Lennon couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that they would always be a sapling, forever overshadowed by others.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saw a travelling merchant arrive in town with a wagon overflowing with exotic fruits, their colors vibrant and enticing. Lennon, who had only ever seen the same few varieties grown in their village, felt a surge of longing, imagining the taste of those distant fruits and the admiration they would surely bring.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their father to let them apprentice with a travelling fruit merchant.  The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears. They sold out by midday, earning a tidy profit, but the joy of success was fleeting, replaced by the nagging thought that Silas had likely made twice as much in the same time.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: 1 coin<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>1 coin</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary>Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[13 Sep 1895 00:10:00  - 14 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Lennon Figtree is at the market in Fruitville trying to buy apples from Cedric Meadowbrook.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in the market.

Lennon, who had only ever seen the same few varieties grown in their village, felt a surge of longing, imagining the taste of those distant fruits and the admiration they would surely bring.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their father to let them apprentice with a travelling fruit merchant.  The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears. They sold out by midday, earning a tidy profit, but the joy of success was fleeting, replaced by the nagging thought that Silas had likely made twice as much in the same time.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Cedric knew it wasn&#x27;t fair; he had been sitting closer to their mother when she cut the pie. He pointed it out, his voice shaking with indignation, but his mother merely smiled and told him to eat his own slice.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he bartered a handful of marbles for a wooden toy soldier from a classmate. He had negotiated fiercely, driving the price down to a single, slightly chipped marble, even though the soldier was clearly worth more. As he walked home, clutching his prize, Cedric felt a surge of pride.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he helped his father sell apples at the local market. Cedric noticed that a customer was trying to sneak an extra apple into her basket while his father was distracted. Cedric called her out, his voice sharp and accusatory, causing a scene that embarrassed both his father and the customer.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he started helping his father with their fruit business. He learned to identify ripe fruit, judge its quality, and haggle with customers. He took pride in getting the best prices for their produce, even if it meant being confrontational.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he convinced his father to let him take a cart of fruit to a neighboring town to sell. He managed to sell out his entire stock, making a small profit. The experience fueled Cedric&#x27;s desire to be his own boss and control his own destiny.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he struck out on his own as a travelling fruit merchant. He traveled from town to town, peddling his wares and negotiating prices with a cold, calculating eye.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Lennon tried to mimic the movements, but his dough remained a lumpy mess, and the baker&#x27;s son, with a kind smile, simply said, &quot;It takes time, young Lennon, just keep practicing.&quot;  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed the blacksmith&#x27;s daughter, barely older than Lennon, hammer a horseshoe with such precision and power that it seemed to sing. Lennon, who struggled to lift the hammer, felt a pang of envy, wishing they possessed such strength and skill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father mend a fence, their hands clumsy and slow compared to their father&#x27;s sure and steady movements. Their father, noticing Lennon&#x27;s frustration, said, &quot;Patience, son, even the tallest tree starts as a small sapling.&quot; But Lennon couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that they would always be a sapling, forever overshadowed by others.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saw a travelling merchant arrive in town with a wagon overflowing with exotic fruits, their colors vibrant and enticing. Lennon, who had only ever seen the same few varieties grown in their village, felt a surge of longing, imagining the taste of those distant fruits and the admiration they would surely bring.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their father to let them apprentice with a travelling fruit merchant.  The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears. They sold out by midday, earning a tidy profit, but the joy of success was fleeting, replaced by the nagging thought that Silas had likely made twice as much in the same time.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Lennon, who had only ever seen the same few varieties grown in their village, felt a surge of longing, imagining the taste of those distant fruits and the admiration they would surely bring.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their father to let them apprentice with a travelling fruit merchant.  The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears. They sold out by midday, earning a tidy profit, but the joy of success was fleeting, replaced by the nagging thought that Silas had likely made twice as much in the same time.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in the market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know this is prime fruit, the sweetest in the market.

Lennon tried to mimic the movements, but his dough remained a lumpy mess, and the baker&#x27;s son, with a kind smile, simply said, &quot;It takes time, young Lennon, just keep practicing.&quot;  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they witnessed the blacksmith&#x27;s daughter, barely older than Lennon, hammer a horseshoe with such precision and power that it seemed to sing. Lennon, who struggled to lift the hammer, felt a pang of envy, wishing they possessed such strength and skill.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they helped their father mend a fence, their hands clumsy and slow compared to their father&#x27;s sure and steady movements. Their father, noticing Lennon&#x27;s frustration, said, &quot;Patience, son, even the tallest tree starts as a small sapling.&quot; But Lennon couldn&#x27;t shake the feeling that they would always be a sapling, forever overshadowed by others.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they saw a travelling merchant arrive in town with a wagon overflowing with exotic fruits, their colors vibrant and enticing. Lennon, who had only ever seen the same few varieties grown in their village, felt a surge of longing, imagining the taste of those distant fruits and the admiration they would surely bring.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they finally convinced their father to let them apprentice with a travelling fruit merchant.  The merchant, Silas, was gruff but fair, teaching Lennon the intricacies of the trade. But even as Lennon learned to haggle and bargain, they couldn&#x27;t help but compare themselves to Silas, envying his experience and the ease with which he commanded respect.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they made their first solo trip to a neighboring town, their wagon laden with apples and pears.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: 2 coins<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>2 coins</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 Sep 1895 20:10:00  - 15 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Della Plumstone is negotiating the price of peaches with Lennon Figtree at the Fruitville market and is planning to resell them in her home town.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Della Plumstone:<br />[&#x27;[15 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the heart of Fruitville, the market square transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun rose.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
