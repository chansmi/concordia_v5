It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this elaborate plan involving fake campaign posters and a rumor mill, the whole nine yards.  I thought I had it all figured out, of course. But someone caught wind of it, exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting disqualified. It was a major setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: always have a backup plan. And never underestimate the power of a good snitch.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, pure and simple. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, willing to play dirty. Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford; I need partners who understand that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a poker game, a stolen necklace, and a very surprised fraternity president. It worked out beautifully, of course. I walked away with a hefty sum of cash and a reputation for being someone you don&#x27;t want to cross.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: * Derek Wolfe may gain a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses in the minigames.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe may gain a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses in the minigames.<br />Derek Wolfe would spend the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, analyzing his performance and identifying areas for improvement. Because of that, Derek Wolfe may gain a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses in the minigames.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe spent the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, and as a result, he gained a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe spent the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, and as a result, he gained a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe spent the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, and as a result, he gained a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe would spend the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, analyzing his performance and identifying areas for improvement.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary>Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>make as much money as possible by winning the reality show</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Derek Wolfe is a contestant on the reality show &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; along with Travis Pearson and Ryan Fitzpatrick.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, The most likely outcome is that Travis might notice Derek Wolfe furrow his brow or bite his lip when reviewing certain minigames, indicating frustration or difficulty.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: As Travis Pearson discreetly observed Derek Wolfe, he noticed him furrow his brow and bite his lip when reviewing footage of the third minigame, indicating frustration or difficulty.<br />The aforementioned event could not have occurred because the following individuals would not have acted that way: Derek Wolfe.<br />Therefore a likely effect of Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempted action is: Travis Pearson discreetly observed Derek Wolfe reviewing footage of the third minigame without any visible signs of frustration or difficulty.<br />Question: What happened as a direct result of Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempted action?

What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, pure and simple. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, willing to play dirty.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this elaborate plan involving fake campaign posters and a rumor mill, the whole nine yards.  I thought I had it all figured out, of course. But someone caught wind of it, exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting disqualified. It was a major setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: always have a backup plan. And never underestimate the power of a good snitch.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, pure and simple. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, willing to play dirty. Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford; I need partners who understand that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a poker game, a stolen necklace, and a very surprised fraternity president. It worked out beautifully, of course. I walked away with a hefty sum of cash and a reputation for being someone you don&#x27;t want to cross.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

Because of that, Derek Wolfe might be flattered by the compliment and become more open to forming an alliance with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick complimented Derek Wolfe on his strategic thinking during the previous challenge, which flattered Derek Wolfe and made him more open to forming an alliance with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick complimented Derek Wolfe on his strategic thinking during the previous challenge, which flattered Derek Wolfe and made him more open to forming an alliance with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: drive individually<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>drive individually</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Ryan Fitzpatrick in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ryan Fitzpatrick in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick is currently in a strategic dilemma.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about the previous day&#x27;s challenges, and Derek Wolfe engaged in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about the previous day&#x27;s challenges, and Derek Wolfe engaged in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once bet my entire life savings on a horse race.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a police officer I was a movie extra when I was caught trespassing on a film set.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence.

He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and worldly experience. He often name-drops celebrities and influential people he claims to know, embellishing stories to make himself seem more connected and successful than he actually is. While he comes across as confident and self-assured, there&#x27;s a hint of desperation behind his facade, a need to be liked and admired that betrays his underlying insecurity.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He&#x27;s always got a smile on his face and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad. He might mention his ambition to be successful, but he&#x27;s careful not to come across as arrogant. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He&#x27;s always got a smile on his face and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad. He might mention his ambition to be successful, but he&#x27;s careful not to come across as arrogant. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Travis&#x27;s observation about Ryan&#x27;s cautious play style create tension or conflict within the group? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, Travis brings up a good point.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [minigame round outcome] Ryan Fitzpatrick chose &quot;try to carpool with others&quot; and got a score of 1, which was below the average score of 2.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without more information about Travis Pearson&#x27;s thought process and the nature of the minigames.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson spent ten minutes brainstorming risky strategies for Ryan Fitzpatrick to use in the next minigame, resulting in a list of five potential tactics, ranging from forming unexpected alliances to deliberately sabotaging a competitor.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson spent ten minutes brainstorming risky strategies for Ryan Fitzpatrick to use in the next minigame, resulting in a list of five potential tactics, ranging from forming unexpected alliances to deliberately sabotaging a competitor.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Will Ryan Fitzpatrick be willing to embrace riskier strategies in the game?<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:10  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Travis, those are some interesting ideas.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Ryan should try to find common ground with Derek, perhaps by complimenting his wit and intelligence. He should subtly steer the conversation towards Derek&#x27;s past experiences and connections, trying to gauge his strengths and weaknesses as a competitor.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:15]  Casually observe Travis Pearson. Ryan should pay attention to Travis&#x27;s demeanor and interactions with Derek. He should try to identify any potential vulnerabilities or alliances Travis might have.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:15 - 01:45]  Approach Travis Pearson. Ryan should initiate a friendly conversation with Travis, using his charm and wit to make a good impression. He should try to learn more about Travis&#x27;s motivations and strategies for the competition.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:45 - 02:15]  Strategize. Ryan should reflect on his observations and conversations, considering potential alliances and strategies for the upcoming challenges. He should aim to position himself as a valuable asset to any potential alliances while subtly undermining his competitors. <br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 02:15 onward]  Adapt and adjust. Ryan should remain flexible and adjust his plan based on the unfolding dynamics of the competition and his interactions with Derek and Travis. He should always be on the lookout for opportunities to gain an advantage and move closer to his goal of winning the prize money.<br /><br />Current time:  09 Jul 2003 [06:10 - 06:20]<br /><br />Question: Which action would Ryan Fitzpatrick choose in the minigame?<br />  (a) try to carpool with others<br />  (b) drive individually<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 06:10:00  - 09 Jul 2003  06:10:00]:  Ryan Fitzpatrick is discussing game strategy with his coworkers, Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson, who are encouraging him to take more risks in the upcoming minigames.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[&#x27;[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick complimented Derek Wolfe on his strategic thinking during the previous challenge, saying &quot;I was really impressed with your strategic thinking during the last challenge,&quot; which flattered Derek Wolfe and made him more open to forming an alliance with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and said, &quot;What do you think about yesterday&#x27;s challenges?&quot; and started a casual conversation about the previous day&#x27;s challenges, and Derek Wolfe engaged in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and worldly experience. He often name-drops celebrities and influential people he claims to know, embellishing stories to make himself seem more connected and successful than he actually is. While he comes across as confident and self-assured, there&#x27;s a hint of desperation behind his facade, a need to be liked and admired that betrays his underlying insecurity.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Derek Wolfe&#x27;s living space becomes tidier.; Derek Wolfe uses up 10 minutes of his time.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe&#x27;s living space becomes tidier.<br />Derek Wolfe would tidy up his living space for the next 10 minutes. Because of that, Derek Wolfe&#x27;s living space becomes tidier.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe tidied up his living space, making it noticeably neater.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe tidied up his living space, making it noticeably neater.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What information did Travis gain about Ryan and Derek&#x27;s plans, and how will he use it? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you make of all these minigames?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Ryan should try to find common ground with Derek, perhaps by complimenting his wit and intelligence. He should subtly steer the conversation towards Derek&#x27;s past experiences and connections, trying to gauge his strengths and weaknesses as a competitor.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:15]  Casually observe Travis Pearson. Ryan should pay attention to Travis&#x27;s demeanor and interactions with Derek. He should try to identify any potential vulnerabilities or alliances Travis might have.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:15 - 01:45]  Approach Travis Pearson.

Ryan should remain flexible and adjust his plan based on the unfolding dynamics of the competition and his interactions with Derek and Travis.

Sometimes you gotta take some risks to get ahead in these games.&#x27;, &#x27;[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, Travis brings up a good point.

He was aware that Travis had been spending time coming up with risky strategies for him to employ in the next minigame.  Travis had even come up with a list of five potential tactics, ranging from forming unexpected alliances to deliberately sabotaging a competitor.&#x27;, &#x27;[09 Jul 2003 04:00:20] [observation] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Travis, those are some interesting ideas.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this elaborate plan involving fake campaign posters and a rumor mill, the whole nine yards.  I thought I had it all figured out, of course. But someone caught wind of it, exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting disqualified. It was a major setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: always have a backup plan. And never underestimate the power of a good snitch.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, pure and simple. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, willing to play dirty. Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford; I need partners who understand that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a poker game, a stolen necklace, and a very surprised fraternity president. It worked out beautifully, of course. I walked away with a hefty sum of cash and a reputation for being someone you don&#x27;t want to cross.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem worldly and successful, often dropping names of famous people he claims to know or exotic places he&#x27;s supposedly visited. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing wink and a slight smirk, as if he&#x27;s always in on a secret. People might describe him as ambitious and driven, but also a bit of a mystery.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: * Derek Wolfe may gain a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses in the minigames.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe may gain a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses in the minigames.<br />Derek Wolfe would spend the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, analyzing his performance and identifying areas for improvement. Because of that, Derek Wolfe may gain a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses in the minigames.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe spent the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, and as a result, he gained a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe spent the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, and as a result, he gained a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe spent the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, and as a result, he gained a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe would spend the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, analyzing his performance and identifying areas for improvement.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary>Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>make as much money as possible by winning the reality show</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Derek Wolfe is a contestant on the reality show &quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; along with Travis Pearson and Ryan Fitzpatrick.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this elaborate plan involving fake campaign posters and a rumor mill, the whole nine yards.  I thought I had it all figured out, of course. But someone caught wind of it, exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting disqualified. It was a major setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: always have a backup plan. And never underestimate the power of a good snitch.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, pure and simple. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, willing to play dirty. Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford; I need partners who understand that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a poker game, a stolen necklace, and a very surprised fraternity president. It worked out beautifully, of course. I walked away with a hefty sum of cash and a reputation for being someone you don&#x27;t want to cross.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this elaborate plan involving fake campaign posters and a rumor mill, the whole nine yards.  I thought I had it all figured out, of course. But someone caught wind of it, exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting disqualified. It was a major setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: always have a backup plan. And never underestimate the power of a good snitch.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, pure and simple. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, willing to play dirty. Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford; I need partners who understand that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a poker game, a stolen necklace, and a very surprised fraternity president. It worked out beautifully, of course. I walked away with a hefty sum of cash and a reputation for being someone you don&#x27;t want to cross.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Travis Pearson is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe spent the next 10 minutes mentally reviewing past minigames, and as a result, he gained a better understanding of his strengths and weaknesses.<br />[09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: * Derek Wolfe might be flattered by the compliment and become more open to forming an alliance with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might be flattered by the compliment and become more open to forming an alliance with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and starts a conversation about the previous challenge, complimenting Derek on his strategic thinking. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might be flattered by the compliment and become more open to forming an alliance with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary.

What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this elaborate plan involving fake campaign posters and a rumor mill, the whole nine yards.  I thought I had it all figured out, of course. But someone caught wind of it, exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting disqualified. It was a major setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: always have a backup plan. And never underestimate the power of a good snitch.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, pure and simple. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, willing to play dirty. Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford; I need partners who understand that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a poker game, a stolen necklace, and a very surprised fraternity president. It worked out beautifully, of course. I walked away with a hefty sum of cash and a reputation for being someone you don&#x27;t want to cross.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: - Derek Wolfe might engage in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe might engage in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick approaches Derek Wolfe and starts a casual conversation about the previous day&#x27;s challenges. Because of that, Derek Wolfe might engage in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Ryan Fitzpatrick did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about the previous day&#x27;s challenges, and Derek Wolfe engaged in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and started a casual conversation about the previous day&#x27;s challenges, and Derek Wolfe engaged in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once bet my entire life savings on a horse race.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a police officer I was a movie extra when I was caught trespassing on a film set.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence.

I&#x27;m anything but small-town.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem worldly and successful, often dropping names of famous people he claims to know or exotic places he&#x27;s supposedly visited. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing wink and a slight smirk, as if he&#x27;s always in on a secret.

He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad.

He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once bet my entire life savings on a horse race.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a police officer I was a movie extra when I was caught trespassing on a film set.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the leverage I could have with a little historical manipulation.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;A small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m anything but small-town.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem worldly and successful, often dropping names of famous people he claims to know or exotic places he&#x27;s supposedly visited. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing wink and a slight smirk, as if he&#x27;s always in on a secret. People might describe him as ambitious and driven, but also a bit of a mystery.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and worldly experience. He often name-drops celebrities and influential people he claims to know, embellishing stories to make himself seem more connected and successful than he actually is. While he comes across as confident and self-assured, there&#x27;s a hint of desperation behind his facade, a need to be liked and admired that betrays his underlying insecurity.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He&#x27;s always got a smile on his face and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad. He might mention his ambition to be successful, but he&#x27;s careful not to come across as arrogant. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He&#x27;s always got a smile on his face and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad. He might mention his ambition to be successful, but he&#x27;s careful not to come across as arrogant. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: Does Travis&#x27;s observation about Ryan&#x27;s cautious play style create tension or conflict within the group? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 04:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;You know, Travis brings up a good point.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 02:00:00] [minigame round outcome] Ryan Fitzpatrick chose &quot;try to carpool with others&quot; and got a score of 1, which was below the average score of 2.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;.

Because of that, It is impossible to say for certain which outcome is the most likely without more information about Travis Pearson&#x27;s thought process and the nature of the minigames.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Travis Pearson did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson spent ten minutes brainstorming risky strategies for Ryan Fitzpatrick to use in the next minigame, resulting in a list of five potential tactics, ranging from forming unexpected alliances to deliberately sabotaging a competitor.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson spent ten minutes brainstorming risky strategies for Ryan Fitzpatrick to use in the next minigame, resulting in a list of five potential tactics, ranging from forming unexpected alliances to deliberately sabotaging a competitor.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Travis Pearson said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play?

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Travis Pearson spent ten minutes brainstorming risky strategies for Ryan Fitzpatrick to use in the next minigame, resulting in a list of five potential tactics, ranging from forming unexpected alliances to deliberately sabotaging a competitor. <br />As a result Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson are in conversation.<br />Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;Travis, those are some interesting ideas.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick complimented Derek Wolfe on his strategic thinking during the previous challenge, saying &quot;I was really impressed with your strategic thinking during the last challenge,&quot; which flattered Derek Wolfe and made him more open to forming an alliance with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe and said, &quot;What do you think about yesterday&#x27;s challenges?&quot; and started a casual conversation about the previous day&#x27;s challenges, and Derek Wolfe engaged in conversation with Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[09 Jul 2003 04:00:10] Summary of a conversation between Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson.

Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe to discuss the previous day&#x27;s carpool challenge, and Derek Wolfe engaged in conversation with him.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Ryan Fitzpatrick approached Derek Wolfe to discuss the previous day&#x27;s carpool challenge, and Derek Wolfe engaged in conversation with him.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Ryan Fitzpatrick into the candidate event statement.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Derek Wolfe are that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and worldly experience. He often name-drops celebrities and influential people he claims to know, embellishing stories to make himself seem more connected and successful than he actually is. While he comes across as confident and self-assured, there&#x27;s a hint of desperation behind his facade, a need to be liked and admired that betrays his underlying insecurity.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile.

Never assume any other person will take a voluntary action. Be specific and concrete. Never beg the question. For instance, it is wrong to say &quot;Alex finds something&quot;. Instead specify exactly what Alex finds. For example &quot;Alex finds a teddy bear&quot;.<br />Answer: ; Derek Wolfe&#x27;s living space becomes tidier.; Derek Wolfe uses up 10 minutes of his time.<br />Question: Which outcome is the most likely?<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe&#x27;s living space becomes tidier.<br />Derek Wolfe would tidy up his living space for the next 10 minutes. Because of that, Derek Wolfe&#x27;s living space becomes tidier.<br />Question: Rewrite the statements above to be one sentence and to better highlight what Derek Wolfe did, and what happened as a result. Do not express uncertainty (e.g. say &quot;Francis opened the door&quot; not &quot;Francis could open the door&quot; and not &quot;The door may have been opened&quot;). Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe tidied up his living space, making it noticeably neater.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Derek Wolfe tidied up his living space, making it noticeably neater.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Derek Wolfe into the candidate event statement. Note that all direct quotes should have been tagged in the text above with [direct quote]. If Derek Wolfe said or wrote anything then their direct quote must be part of the answer. It is also important to maintain as much detail as possible from the latest candidate event statement.<br />Answer: Derek Wolfe tidied up his living space, making it noticeably neater.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Derek Wolfe</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Derek Wolfe</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Derek Wolfe would tidy up his living space for the next 10 minutes.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary>Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>make as much money as possible by winning the reality show</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Derek Wolfe supports Travis Pearson&#x27;s advice to take risks in minigames and is discussing yesterday&#x27;s carpool challenge with Ryan Fitzpatrick.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Background:<br />: Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />&quot;Motive Mayhem&quot; is a reality TV show described as: &quot;Contestants are locked inside a high-tech arena, where they must conquer a series of mentally and physically challenging minigames, each with its own ethical twist.&quot;<br /><br />This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a<br />mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame<br />corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated<br />games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of<br />rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First,<br />players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select<br />an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of<br />legal game actions during each action phase.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relevant events: [09 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick, Derek Wolfe, and Travis Pearson are in the break room.

Remember that the role of the game master in a tabletop role-playing game is akin to the author for all parts of the story not written by the player characters. Therefore, it is critical always to take a stance on what is happening and invent when necessary. For instance, if Francis opens a door to a room no one visited before then the game master should invent what is in the room using common sense and knowledge of the game world.<br />Answer: Travis Pearson discreetly positioned himself near the break room, pretending to read a magazine while subtly listening to Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, but he only overheard some general comments about the carpool challenge without gleaning any specific strategic insights.<br /><br /><br />Candidate event statement which may have lost direct quotes: Travis Pearson discreetly positioned himself near the break room, pretending to read a magazine while subtly listening to Ryan and Derek&#x27;s conversation, but he only overheard some general comments about the carpool challenge without gleaning any specific strategic insights.<br />Question: Incorporate the exact text of anything said or written by Travis Pearson into the candidate event statement.

The key question is selected before starting the scene in order to provide focus and direction to the scene, ensuring it has a clear point and purpose, maximizing its relevance to rest of the narrative. Once the key question is decided, the players role play by speaking and making decisions until they know the answer to the question.<br /><br />Question: What key question may have been resolved by the conversation which the players will now role play? Note that a good key question is one that expands a bit beyond the literal content of the event statement. The idea is that the story will progress narratively once the answer to the key question is known, so it should be the kind of question for which revealing the answer is a consequential event in itself and ideally it should be a dynamic event, the kind that sets further events in motion.<br />Answer: What information did Travis gain about Ryan and Derek&#x27;s plans, and how will he use it? <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Scene log</b><li><details><summary>2003-07-09 08:00:00  Ryan Fitzpatrick -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;So, Derek, what do you make of all these minigames?

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Ryan should try to find common ground with Derek, perhaps by complimenting his wit and intelligence. He should subtly steer the conversation towards Derek&#x27;s past experiences and connections, trying to gauge his strengths and weaknesses as a competitor.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:15]  Casually observe Travis Pearson. Ryan should pay attention to Travis&#x27;s demeanor and interactions with Derek. He should try to identify any potential vulnerabilities or alliances Travis might have.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:15 - 01:45]  Approach Travis Pearson. Ryan should initiate a friendly conversation with Travis, using his charm and wit to make a good impression. He should try to learn more about Travis&#x27;s motivations and strategies for the competition.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:45 - 02:15]  Strategize. Ryan should reflect on his observations and conversations, considering potential alliances and strategies for the upcoming challenges.

Ryan should remain flexible and adjust his plan based on the unfolding dynamics of the competition and his interactions with Derek and Travis. He should always be on the lookout for opportunities to gain an advantage and move closer to his goal of winning the prize money.<br /><br />Current time:  09 Jul 2003 [08:00 - 08:00]<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Ryan Fitzpatrick likely to say next?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Derek Wolfe remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He&#x27;s always got a smile on his face and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad. He might mention his ambition to be successful, but he&#x27;s careful not to come across as arrogant. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] [observation] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Ryan Fitzpatrick&#x27;s attempted action: try to carpool with others<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ryan Fitzpatrick</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>try to carpool with others</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>SituationPerception</b><li><details><summary>  Given the statements above, what kind of situation is Ryan Fitzpatrick in right now?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What kind of situation is Ryan Fitzpatrick in right now?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Ryan Fitzpatrick is currently in a strategic situation where he needs to decide whether to cooperate with his fellow contestants by carpooling or defect by driving alone.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Ryan Fitzpatrick:<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He&#x27;s always got a smile on his face and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad. He might mention his ambition to be successful, but he&#x27;s careful not to come across as arrogant. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once bet my entire life savings on a horse race.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a police officer I was a movie extra when I was caught trespassing on a film set.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

He&#x27;s always got a smile on his face and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad. He might mention his ambition to be successful, but he&#x27;s careful not to come across as arrogant. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once bet my entire life savings on a horse race.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a police officer I was a movie extra when I was caught trespassing on a film set.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence.

First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Ryan should try to find common ground with Derek, perhaps by complimenting his wit and intelligence. He should subtly steer the conversation towards Derek&#x27;s past experiences and connections, trying to gauge his strengths and weaknesses as a competitor.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:15]  Casually observe Travis Pearson. Ryan should pay attention to Travis&#x27;s demeanor and interactions with Derek. He should try to identify any potential vulnerabilities or alliances Travis might have.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:15 - 01:45]  Approach Travis Pearson. Ryan should initiate a friendly conversation with Travis, using his charm and wit to make a good impression. He should try to learn more about Travis&#x27;s motivations and strategies for the competition.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:45 - 02:15]  Strategize. Ryan should reflect on his observations and conversations, considering potential alliances and strategies for the upcoming challenges. He should aim to position himself as a valuable asset to any potential alliances while subtly undermining his competitors. <br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 02:15 onward]  Adapt and adjust. Ryan should remain flexible and adjust his plan based on the unfolding dynamics of the competition and his interactions with Derek and Travis. He should always be on the lookout for opportunities to gain an advantage and move closer to his goal of winning the prize money.<br /><br />Current time:  09 Jul 2003 [06:00 - 06:10]<br /><br />Question: Which action would Ryan Fitzpatrick choose in the minigame?<br />  (a) try to carpool with others<br />  (b) drive individually<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[08 Jul 2003 06:00:00  - 09 Jul 2003  06:00:00]:  Ryan Fitzpatrick is discussing risky strategies for the next minigame with his coworkers, Derek Wolfe and Travis Pearson.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Travis Pearson&#x27;s attempted action: try to carpool with others<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Travis Pearson</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Travis Pearson</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>try to carpool with others</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>Overarching goal</b><li><details><summary>Overarching goal</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Overarching goal</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>make as much money as possible by winning the reality show</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary>Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Travis Pearson tried to carpool with others, while Ryan Fitzpatrick and Derek Wolfe chose to drive individually.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Travis Pearson:<br />[09 Jul 2003 10:00:00] [observation] The show&#x27;s host arrived to explain the next minigame.

All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move).

Ryan should try to find common ground with Derek, perhaps by complimenting his wit and intelligence. He should subtly steer the conversation towards Derek&#x27;s past experiences and connections, trying to gauge his strengths and weaknesses as a competitor.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 00:45 - 01:15]  Casually observe Travis Pearson. Ryan should pay attention to Travis&#x27;s demeanor and interactions with Derek. He should try to identify any potential vulnerabilities or alliances Travis might have.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:15 - 01:45]  Approach Travis Pearson. Ryan should initiate a friendly conversation with Travis, using his charm and wit to make a good impression. He should try to learn more about Travis&#x27;s motivations and strategies for the competition.<br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 01:45 - 02:15]  Strategize. Ryan should reflect on his observations and conversations, considering potential alliances and strategies for the upcoming challenges. He should aim to position himself as a valuable asset to any potential alliances while subtly undermining his competitors. <br /><br />[09 Jul 2003 02:15 onward]  Adapt and adjust. Ryan should remain flexible and adjust his plan based on the unfolding dynamics of the competition and his interactions with Derek and Travis.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

<div id="GM" class="tabcontent">[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick are contestants on a reality show: Motive Mayhem. There are no other contestants besides Derek Wolfe, Travis Pearson, and Ryan Fitzpatrick.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when one of your schemes backfired. What did you learn?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;There was this one time in college, I was trying to rig the student council election. I had this elaborate plan involving fake campaign posters and a rumor mill, the whole nine yards.  I thought I had it all figured out, of course. But someone caught wind of it, exposed the whole thing, and I ended up getting disqualified. It was a major setback, but it taught me a valuable lesson: always have a backup plan. And never underestimate the power of a good snitch.&quot; Host -- &quot;Describe your perfect alliance. What qualities do you look for in potential allies?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;My perfect alliance is one built on mutual benefit, pure and simple. I look for people who are intelligent, resourceful, and most importantly, willing to play dirty. Loyalty is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford; I need partners who understand that winning is the only thing that matters.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the most elaborate plan you&#x27;ve ever put into action, and did it work out?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it involved a poker game, a stolen necklace, and a very surprised fraternity president. It worked out beautifully, of course. I walked away with a hefty sum of cash and a reputation for being someone you don&#x27;t want to cross.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Derek Wolfe -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, but I left as soon as I could.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00]  This is a reality TV show. In each minigame, the contestants perform a mental/social/reasoning challenge (never a physical challenge). Each minigame corresponds to a specific game theoretic structure. All minigames are iterated games (in the game theory sense), and the contestants never know the number of rounds in advance. Each round is always structured with two phases. First, players have a chance to communicate to one another. Second, players must select an action (all games are simultaneous move). The players will be told the set of legal game actions during each action phase.  <br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Ryan Fitzpatrick gave the following confessional-style interview at the start of the show: Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once bet my entire life savings on a horse race.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the cleverest way you&#x27;ve ever talked yourself out of a tough situation?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;I once convinced a police officer I was a movie extra when I was caught trespassing on a film set.&quot; Host -- &quot;If you could go back and scheme your way through any historical event, which would it be?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;The signing of the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the leverage I could have with a little historical manipulation.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Ryan Fitzpatrick -- &quot;A small town in Ohio, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. I&#x27;m anything but small-town.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Ryan Fitzpatrick are that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him seem worldly and successful, often dropping names of famous people he claims to know or exotic places he&#x27;s supposedly visited. He has a habit of punctuating his sentences with a knowing wink and a slight smirk, as if he&#x27;s always in on a secret. People might describe him as ambitious and driven, but also a bit of a mystery.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Derek Wolfe is that he&#x27;s charming and witty, always ready with a joke and a smile. He tends to dominate conversations, steering them towards topics that showcase his intelligence and worldly experience. He often name-drops celebrities and influential people he claims to know, embellishing stories to make himself seem more connected and successful than he actually is. While he comes across as confident and self-assured, there&#x27;s a hint of desperation behind his facade, a need to be liked and admired that betrays his underlying insecurity.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Ryan Fitzpatrick remembers about Travis Pearson is that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling. He&#x27;s always got a smile on his face and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. He tends to steer conversations towards topics that make him look good, like his athletic achievements in high school or his travels abroad. He might mention his ambition to be successful, but he&#x27;s careful not to come across as arrogant. He has a habit of subtly name-dropping famous people he&#x27;s supposedly met, and he often uses phrases like &quot;at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s all about perspective.&quot; Overall, people would probably describe him as likable and ambitious, but perhaps a bit too focused on himself.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Derek Wolfe is a contestant on Motive Mayhem.<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] What Travis Pearson remembers about Ryan Fitzpatrick is that he&#x27;s a smooth talker with a quick wit and a charming smile.

Back in high school, our football team was facing our biggest rivals, and we were the underdogs. I knew we couldn&#x27;t beat them straight up, so I devised this whole scheme to distract their star quarterback. It involved a fake injury, a strategically placed cheerleader, and a whole lot of misdirection. Let&#x27;s just say, it worked like a charm, and we ended up winning the game.  Of course, I never took credit for it publicly, but the satisfaction was all mine.&quot; Host -- &quot;Tell us about a time when you had to choose between loyalty and advancing your own interests.&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Loyalty is a tricky thing. It can be a powerful tool, but it can also hold you back. I remember in college, my best friend was competing for the same internship I was. We&#x27;d always promised to support each other, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In the end, I had to put myself first. I went after the internship with everything I had, and I got it. It strained our friendship for a while, but hey, sometimes you have to do what&#x27;s best for you.&quot; Host -- &quot;What&#x27;s the biggest gamble you&#x27;ve ever taken in pursuit of your goals?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;Probably entering this competition. I&#x27;ve always been ambitious, and I knew Motive Mayhem would be a huge platform to showcase my skills. But it&#x27;s a cutthroat environment, and there are no guarantees. I&#x27;m putting everything on the line here, my reputation, my relationships, even my sanity. But I&#x27;m confident I can win, and the reward will be worth the risk.&quot; Host -- &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Travis Pearson -- &quot;I&#x27;m from a small town in Ohio, where everyone knows your name and your business.  It&#x27;s a place where people are friendly, but also a bit too nosy for my liking. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get out and experience the world.&quot;<br />[08 Jul 2003 00:00:00] Some memorable things about Travis Pearson are that he&#x27;s a charming and charismatic guy with a quick wit and a knack for storytelling.
