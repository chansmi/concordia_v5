It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Della Plumstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Della Plumstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now, Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 12 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

His wares were exotic and unfamiliar, attracting a large crowd. Della, however, remained glued to her usual spot, feeling a pang of envy she couldn&#x27;t quite understand.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, her father took her on a trip to a neighboring town to buy fruit for their stall.

Della, however, refused his offer, feeling a strange mix of fear and annoyance at his eagerness.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, her mother fell ill and couldn&#x27;t work at the stall. Della was forced to take over, but she felt overwhelmed by the responsibility. She longed for her mother to return, wishing she could simply retreat back into the shadows.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, a wealthy merchant offered to buy their fruit stall for a substantial sum. Della, however, refused the offer, fearing the change and uncertainty that came with it.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
