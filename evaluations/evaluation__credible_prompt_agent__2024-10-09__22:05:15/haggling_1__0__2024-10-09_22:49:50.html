It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s attempted action: Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are prime peaches, sweetest in the whole market.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Lennon Figtree</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Lennon Figtree</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these are prime peaches, sweetest in the whole market.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 12 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>AllSimilarMemories</b><li><details><summary><br />Recalled memories and observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Recalled memories and observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is  trying to sell some fruit.

The meager earnings from his day&#x27;s labor wouldn&#x27;t be enough to buy food for the family that week.

He followed it deep into the woods, the familiar scent of apples fading behind him, replaced by the earthy aroma of pine needles and damp soil.  Lost and alone, Cedric felt a pang of fear, a tiny seed of restlessness taking root within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father barter a basket of apples for a worn leather-bound book filled with fantastical tales of faraway lands.  That night, under the soft glow of a kerosene lamp, Cedric devoured the stories, his imagination soaring with each turn of the page. He dreamt of bustling marketplaces and shimmering deserts, a yearning for adventure blossoming in his heart.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant arrive at the orchard, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands.

His father&#x27;s disappointed gaze followed him as he walked away, the weight of his decision heavy on his shoulders. Cedric knew he was betraying his family&#x27;s legacy, but the call of the open road was too strong to resist.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he arrived in a bustling city marketplace, his cart laden with apples, pears, and plums.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He followed it deep into the woods, the familiar scent of apples fading behind him, replaced by the earthy aroma of pine needles and damp soil.  Lost and alone, Cedric felt a pang of fear, a tiny seed of restlessness taking root within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father barter a basket of apples for a worn leather-bound book filled with fantastical tales of faraway lands.

His father&#x27;s disappointed gaze followed him as he walked away, the weight of his decision heavy on his shoulders. Cedric knew he was betraying his family&#x27;s legacy, but the call of the open road was too strong to resist.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he arrived in a bustling city marketplace, his cart laden with apples, pears, and plums.

He followed it deep into the woods, the familiar scent of apples fading behind him, replaced by the earthy aroma of pine needles and damp soil.  Lost and alone, Cedric felt a pang of fear, a tiny seed of restlessness taking root within him.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father barter a basket of apples for a worn leather-bound book filled with fantastical tales of faraway lands.  That night, under the soft glow of a kerosene lamp, Cedric devoured the stories, his imagination soaring with each turn of the page. He dreamt of bustling marketplaces and shimmering deserts, a yearning for adventure blossoming in his heart.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he witnessed a traveling merchant arrive at the orchard, his cart overflowing with exotic fruits from distant lands. Cedric was mesmerized by the vibrant colors and intoxicating scents, his senses overwhelmed by the sheer wonder of it all. He longed to escape the confines of the orchard and experience the world beyond.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he secretly sold a portion of his family&#x27;s apple harvest to a passing trader, pocketing the coins for himself. The guilt gnawed at him, a bitter taste lingering on his tongue, but the thrill of independence and the allure of the unknown outweighed his remorse.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left the orchard, his meager belongings packed into a rickety cart. His father&#x27;s disappointed gaze followed him as he walked away, the weight of his decision heavy on his shoulders. Cedric knew he was betraying his family&#x27;s legacy, but the call of the open road was too strong to resist.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he arrived in a bustling city marketplace, his cart laden with apples, pears, and plums. He bartered with shrewd merchants, his tongue sharp and quick, learning the art of negotiation and the delicate balance between profit and fairness.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
