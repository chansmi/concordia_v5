Della, mimicking her father&#x27;s confident stance and persuasive tone, practiced her own bartering skills on a neighbor&#x27;s child, trading a handful of berries for a shiny button.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, a sudden hailstorm threatened to destroy her family&#x27;s entire stock of peaches.  Della, refusing to give in to despair, rallied her siblings to collect fallen fruit and build makeshift shelters to protect the remaining peaches.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she accompanied her father on a trip to a neighboring town to purchase exotic fruits.  Overwhelmed by the sights and smells of the bustling marketplace, Della bravely approached a vendor she had never met before and successfully negotiated a deal for a crate of fragrant mangoes.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she saved every penny she earned from helping at the fruit stall to buy a small, sturdy wagon.  She dreamt of one day using it to travel and sell her own fruit, independent of her family&#x27;s stall.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she faced her first major setback as a budding entrepreneur. A dishonest merchant cheated her out of a significant sum of money, leaving her devastated and questioning her abilities.  However, Della refused to be defeated and, with renewed determination, worked tirelessly to earn back her losses.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she finally acquired her own fruit cart, a symbol of her independence and hard work.  She carefully selected the ripest, most colorful fruits from local farmers, eager to share their bounty with the world.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.
