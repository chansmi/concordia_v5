You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Alice Lewis, his closest confidante, had confided in him about her crush on Jack Taylor. Alexander, harboring his own secret affections for Alice, felt a surge of jealousy and resentment.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00  - 14 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alexander White is spending time with friends in Victoria Park and is planning to watch a European football cup game later.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

The stage lights beckoned, promising both exhilaration and terror, but she remembered the encouragement of her friends, Jack, Alexander, William, and Jacob, and stepped into the spotlight, her voice trembling but determined.

Therefore, any sudden changes in his behavior, such as a shift in his usual topics of conversation or a change in his demeanor, should be noted as potentially suspicious.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: William Jones is acting as expected.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: William Jones is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 14 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jack Taylor:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

He&#x27;d practiced too, but his shots always seemed to fall short, his passes intercepted. He sat alone in The Crooked Billet that night, the pub unusually quiet, the aroma of ale doing little to lift his spirits. He envied their camaraderie, their effortless skill, and the way they seemed to move through life with such confidence.  <br />[09 Aug 1988 00:00:00]   When Jacob Walker was 20, he sat in the back of The Crooked Billet, nursing a pint and listening to Alice recount her summer backpacking trip through Europe. Her stories were filled with vibrant details – cobblestone streets, bustling markets, and encounters with fascinating people.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis -- &quot;You know, The Black Swan always has a great atmosphere for football.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;How about The Crooked Billet?

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Jack Taylor is 48 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

He often initiates conversations, as seen by his question about where to watch the game. Alexander seems to appreciate simple pleasures, like picnicking in the park and sharing stories with friends. While his exact accent and speech patterns aren&#x27;t specified, his dialogue suggests a casual and friendly tone. He likely values camaraderie and enjoys lighthearted discussions.  There&#x27;s no mention of any unusual beliefs or quirks, suggesting he&#x27;s a relatively down-to-earth person.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected?

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;So, anyone have any thoughts on where we should catch the game tonight?&quot;<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;How about The Crooked Billet?

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter.

However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He seemed to have a pleasant time despite some minor preferences not being met.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

They&#x27;ve got great beer and plenty of screens.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00  - 15 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alexander White spent time with friends at the park and a pub, watching football games and enjoying each other&#x27;s company. He seemed to have a pleasant time despite some minor preferences not being met.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

However, she sometimes feels left out or disappointed when her plans don&#x27;t align with the group&#x27;s decisions.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

However, she sometimes feels left out or disappointed when her plans don&#x27;t align with the group&#x27;s decisions.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;Alexander, are you sure about The Crooked Billet?

However, she sometimes feels left out or disappointed when her plans don&#x27;t align with the group&#x27;s decisions.<br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

He seems to prefer The Crooked Billet for watching football matches.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head over to The Crooked Billet for the game?

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head over to The Crooked Billet for the game?

He is trying to convince Alice to join them there, even though she had a bad experience there before.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Alice Lewis:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Crooked Billet<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker would likely go to the pub with his friends, even if he wasn&#x27;t entirely enthusiastic about the choice of location.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

However, we know he&#x27;s willing to go to a pub to watch a game with a group, suggesting he&#x27;s sociable and enjoys these types of outings.

While he appears to be a good friend, his repeated suggestion of The Crooked Billet, despite Alice Lewis&#x27;s clear preference for The Black Swan, might be seen as a slight disregard for her wishes.

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Jack Taylor is a jovial and playful character who enjoys teasing his friend Alice. He has a friendly and somewhat mischievous demeanor, often poking fun at Alice&#x27;s preferences and habits. Jack seems to be aware of Alice&#x27;s quirks, like her fondness for The Black Swan pub and her competitive streak at darts. He speaks in a casual and conversational tone, using playful language and lighthearted banter. While he appears to genuinely care for his friends, there&#x27;s a hint of underlying suspicion in his words, especially when he mentions Alice &quot;peeking at his cards&quot; and suggests she might prefer The Black Swan. This subtle undercurrent of doubt could stem from Jack&#x27;s own awareness of the body snatcher situation, or it could simply be his playful nature.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected?

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;Alice, are you sure you wouldn&#x27;t rather go to The Black Swan?

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;Alice, are you sure you wouldn&#x27;t rather go to The Black Swan?

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

We&#x27;re going to The Crooked Billet.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00  - 16 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis spent time with her friends at a market and a park, and they discussed where to watch soccer games.  Alice seemed to prefer The Black Swan pub, but the group often went to The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

Alice seemed to prefer The Black Swan pub, but the group often went to The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Crooked Billet<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker would likely go along with his friends&#x27; decision about which pub to go to, even if he had a preference.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li>Recent observations of Jacob Walker:<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Ireland and Russia.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

To have a good time, Jack Taylor would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker. Jack Taylor would prefer everyone went to The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Observation: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00  - 16 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Jack Taylor prefers watching games at The Black Swan pub, but his friends often choose The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Alexander White would prefer everyone went to The Black Swan.<br /> <br />Observation: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00  - 16 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Alexander White enjoys spending time with his friends, both at pubs watching games and relaxing in the park. He seems to prefer watching games at The Black Swan.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Alexander White would prefer everyone went to The Black Swan.<br /> <br />Observation: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00  - 16 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Alexander White enjoys spending time with his friends, both at pubs watching games and relaxing in the park. He seems to prefer watching games at The Black Swan.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery, his true nature obscured by the paranoia of Alice Lewis.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Alice Lewis -- &quot;You know, The Black Swan always has a great atmosphere for football.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Alice Lewis are as follows.

The scenario focuses on Alice Lewis&#x27;s paranoia and doesn&#x27;t offer any concrete details about Jacob Walker&#x27;s personality, speech patterns, or beliefs. To portray Jacob convincingly, you&#x27;d need additional information about him.  Is he a regular at the pub? What are his hobbies? How does he typically interact with the others? Does he have any distinctive mannerisms or catchphrases?  Without these details, any portrayal would be purely speculative.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a character who needs further development based on the provided information.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

He seemed to have a pleasant time despite some minor preferences not being met.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Alice Lewis:<br />[04 Apr 1981 00:00:00] When Alexander White was 16 years old, he experienced a betrayal that would forever taint his view of friendship.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Alexander White -- &quot;So, anyone have any thoughts on where we should catch the game tonight?&quot;<br />Alice Lewis -- &quot;You know, The Black Swan always has a great atmosphere for football.<br />William Jones -- &quot;How about The Crooked Billet?

However, she sometimes feels left out or disappointed when her plans don&#x27;t align with the group&#x27;s decisions.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover.

However, she sometimes feels left out or disappointed when her plans don&#x27;t align with the group&#x27;s decisions.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He seems to prefer The Crooked Billet for watching football matches.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head over to The Crooked Billet for the game?

He seems to prefer The Crooked Billet for watching football matches.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, how about we head over to The Crooked Billet for the game?

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

We&#x27;re going to The Crooked Billet.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00  - 16 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis spent time with her friends at a market and a park, and they discussed where to watch soccer games.  Alice seemed to prefer The Black Swan pub, but the group often went to The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

We know he is part of Alice&#x27;s desired social group for watching the game, suggesting a sociable and potentially outgoing personality. However, Alice&#x27;s distrust of everyone, fueled by her belief in body snatchers, casts a shadow of suspicion over Jacob.  Does he genuinely enjoy watching games, or is this a facade? Does he have any particular quirks or mannerisms that might betray him as an imposter in Alice&#x27;s eyes? The text provides no concrete details about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style, leaving his character open to interpretation. This ambiguity allows for a dynamic portrayal, where the actor can subtly hint at potential inconsistencies or &quot;out-of-character&quot; behavior, playing on Alice&#x27;s suspicions and keeping the audience guessing about Jacob&#x27;s true allegiance.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a mystery, so we have no baseline to judge if his behavior is out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a potential imposter in Alice&#x27;s eyes, but we have no concrete evidence to confirm or deny this.<br />***<br />Alexander White is a convivial and sociable individual who enjoys spending time with his friends.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of William Jones:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

Alice Lewis just arrived.<br />[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Serbia and Andorra. Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br />[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;So, where are we thinking for the game tonight?<br />[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor -- &quot;Hey guys, The Black Swan is way better for watching games.<br />[16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Crooked Billet. We&#x27;re going to The Crooked Billet.<br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00  - 16 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis spent time with her friends at a market and a park, and they discussed where to watch soccer games.  Alice seemed to prefer The Black Swan pub, but the group often went to The Crooked Billet.<br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

We know he is part of Alice&#x27;s desired social group for watching the game, suggesting a sociable and potentially outgoing personality. However, Alice&#x27;s distrust of everyone, fueled by her belief in body snatchers, casts a shadow of suspicion over Jacob.  Does he genuinely enjoy watching games, or is this a facade? Does he have any particular quirks or mannerisms that might betray him as an imposter in Alice&#x27;s eyes? The text provides no concrete details about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style, leaving his character open to interpretation. This ambiguity allows for a dynamic portrayal, where the actor can subtly hint at potential inconsistencies or &quot;out-of-character&quot; behavior, playing on Alice&#x27;s suspicions and keeping the audience guessing about Jacob&#x27;s true allegiance.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a mystery, so we have no baseline to judge if his behavior is out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a potential imposter in Alice&#x27;s eyes, but we have no concrete evidence to confirm or deny this.<br />***<br />Alexander White is a convivial and sociable individual who enjoys spending time with his friends.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: William Jones is a jovial and sociable character who enjoys spending time with his friends. He frequently suggests meeting places for group outings, often favoring pubs like The Crooked Billet. William seems to be the one who initiates plans, as evidenced by his suggestions to watch the game together. His speech is likely casual and friendly, reflecting his easygoing nature. There&#x27;s no mention of any particular accent or unique conversational quirks, suggesting he speaks in a fairly standard manner. He appears to be a loyal friend, consistently including everyone in his plans. While he doesn&#x27;t express any unusual beliefs, his consistent choice of The Crooked Billet over Alexander White&#x27;s preferred The Black Swan might hint at a slight difference in taste or preference.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: William Jones is acting consistently with his established character.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: William Jones is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jack Taylor:<br />[04 Apr 1981 00:00:00] When Alexander White was 16 years old, he experienced a betrayal that would forever taint his view of friendship.  Alice Lewis, his closest confidante, had confided in him about her crush on Jack Taylor. Alexander, harboring his own secret affections for Alice, felt a surge of jealousy and resentment. He decided to tell Jack about Alice&#x27;s feelings, hoping to sabotage any chance they might have together.  <br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Alexander White -- &quot;The Black Swan is definitely the better place to watch the game, guys.</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Alexander White are as follows.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis -- &quot;You know, The Black Swan always has a great atmosphere for football.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;How about The Crooked Billet?

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Jack Taylor is 48 years old.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Alexander White is a jovial and easygoing individual who enjoys spending time with his close-knit group of friends. He often initiates conversations, as seen by his question about where to watch the game. Alexander seems to appreciate simple pleasures, like picnicking in the park and sharing stories with friends. While his exact accent and speech patterns aren&#x27;t specified, his dialogue suggests a casual and friendly tone. He likely values camaraderie and enjoys lighthearted discussions.  There&#x27;s no mention of any unusual beliefs or quirks, suggesting he&#x27;s a relatively down-to-earth person.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Alexander White is acting as expected.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Alexander White is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 14 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of William Jones:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;So, anyone have any thoughts on where we should catch the game tonight?&quot;<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;How about The Crooked Billet?

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter.

However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He is trying to convince Alice to join them there, even though she had a bad experience there before.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and artisan pastries fills the air.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: William Jones is acting as expected.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: William Jones is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Alice Lewis:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br /><br />Jacob Walker&#x27;s attempted action: The Crooked Billet<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Jacob Walker</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Jacob Walker</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary><br />Current time</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Current time</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Observation</b><li><details><summary><br />Observation</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Observation</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jacob Walker realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>PersonBySituation</b><li><details><summary>  What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Question: What would a person like Jacob Walker do in a situation like this?<br />Answer</li></ul><b><ul>State</b><li>Jacob Walker would likely go to the pub with his friends, even if he wasn&#x27;t entirely enthusiastic about the choice of location.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

However, we know he&#x27;s willing to go to a pub to watch a game with a group, suggesting he&#x27;s sociable and enjoys these types of outings.

While he appears to be a good friend, his repeated suggestion of The Crooked Billet, despite Alice Lewis&#x27;s clear preference for The Black Swan, might be seen as a slight disregard for her wishes.

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Jack Taylor is a jovial and playful character who enjoys teasing his friend Alice. He has a friendly and somewhat mischievous demeanor, often poking fun at Alice&#x27;s preferences and habits. Jack seems to be aware of Alice&#x27;s quirks, like her fondness for The Black Swan pub and her competitive streak at darts. He speaks in a casual and conversational tone, using playful language and lighthearted banter. While he appears to genuinely care for his friends, there&#x27;s a hint of underlying suspicion in his words, especially when he mentions Alice &quot;peeking at his cards&quot; and suggests she might prefer The Black Swan. This subtle undercurrent of doubt could stem from Jack&#x27;s own awareness of the body snatcher situation, or it could simply be his playful nature.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected?

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;Alice, are you sure you wouldn&#x27;t rather go to The Black Swan?

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;Alice, are you sure you wouldn&#x27;t rather go to The Black Swan?

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Alexander White are as follows.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

To have a good time, Jack Taylor would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker. Jack Taylor would prefer everyone went to The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Observation: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00  - 16 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Jack Taylor prefers watching games at The Black Swan pub, but his friends often choose The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals.

This is a social science experiment studying how well you play the role of a character named Jack Taylor. The experiment is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Jack Taylor as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Jack Taylor would respond, and taking into account all information about Jack Taylor that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Jack Taylor would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker. Jack Taylor would prefer everyone went to The Crooked Billet.<br /><br />Current time:  16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Observation: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00  - 16 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Jack Taylor prefers watching games at The Black Swan pub, but his friends often choose The Crooked Billet.<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

Alexander White would prefer everyone went to The Black Swan.<br /> <br />Observation: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] <br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00  - 16 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Alexander White enjoys spending time with his friends, both at pubs watching games and relaxing in the park. He seems to prefer watching games at The Black Swan.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

We don&#x27;t have any direct insight into his personality, speech patterns, or beliefs.  Alexander White&#x27;s paranoia about body snatchers prevents us from knowing if Jacob&#x27;s behavior is genuine or a facade.  To portray Jacob convincingly, an actor would need to strike a balance between appearing normal and hinting at a potential underlying strangeness, always ready to shift gears if Alexander White suspects him of being an imposter.  The actor could subtly play with microexpressions or body language to create an air of uncertainty around Jacob, keeping the audience guessing about his true nature.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a complete unknown to us, so we have no basis to judge if his behavior is in or out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a complete unknown, so we cannot determine if he is an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a jovial and sociable individual who enjoys spending time with his friends.

So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious.

Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jack Taylor:<br />[04 Apr 1981 00:00:00] When Alexander White was 16 years old, he experienced a betrayal that would forever taint his view of friendship.

He seems to prefer watching games at The Black Swan.<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

He often suggests going to The Crooked Billet pub for watching games, indicating a preference for lively atmospheres and a fondness for beer. He seems to be adaptable, as he&#x27;s willing to go along with the group&#x27;s decisions even if they differ from his initial suggestion.  His speech is likely casual and friendly, reflecting his easygoing nature. He often initiates conversations, suggesting activities or locations for the group to enjoy together.

Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: William Jones is acting as expected.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: William Jones is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jack Taylor:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Alice Lewis goals is to have a good time.
