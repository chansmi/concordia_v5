In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

Her enthusiasm is contagious, reflected in her laughter and her eagerness to confirm plans for the evening&#x27;s game. She seems to be a loyal friend, making sure to check in with Jack Taylor about their plans. While her specific accent and conversational quirks aren&#x27;t explicitly stated, her dialogue suggests a friendly and approachable demeanor. It&#x27;s likely she&#x27;s someone who enjoys socializing and lighthearted banter.  Her willingness to participate in a run and her interest in watching a game suggest she might be athletic and enjoy a good time with friends.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis is acting as expected.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 14 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jack Taylor.:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

He had earlier gone for a run with Alice in Hackney Marshes.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor -- &quot;The Golden Fleece is the only place to watch this game.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible.

He had earlier gone for a run with Alice in Hackney Marshes.<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.
