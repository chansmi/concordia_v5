It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br /><br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s attempted action: Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

He bought the fruit for 1 coin and is trying to sell it for a profit.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is 50 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit.

Cedric noticed that customers were drawn to the vibrant colors and neat rows, prompting them to experiment with different arrangements to maximize appeal.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they constructed a miniature cart using salvaged wood and old wagon wheels. They spent days refining its design, adding compartments for different types of produce and a pulley system for easier loading and unloading.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading trip to a neighboring village. They carefully selected a variety of fruits from their family&#x27;s orchard, displaying them with flair and enthusiasm, and returned home with a newfound confidence in their ability to connect with people through their produce.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who sold exotic fruits from distant lands.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He successfully negotiated a deal with Della Plumstone, making a profit of 3 coins.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can do better than that.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible.

The wind howled and the rain lashed against their small home, but Lennon sat calmly by the window, watching the storm with a sense of wonder rather than fear. Their mother, initially worried by Lennon&#x27;s lack of fear, soon found herself soothed by their quiet presence.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market for the first time. Surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the crowd, Lennon remained calm and collected, their gentle smile and quiet demeanor disarming even the most difficult customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a heated argument between two vendors. Instead of joining the fray, Lennon stepped between the arguing parties, their calm presence diffusing the tension and encouraging a peaceful resolution.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

They are negotiating a price, with Lennon trying to get a better deal.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He recently made a successful deal with Della Plumstone and is currently negotiating a price for plums with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is 50 years old.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can do better than that.

Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

He previously tried to buy something from Cedric Meadowbrook but the deal fell through.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious.

Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He purchased the fruit for 2 coin.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He recently made a successful deal with Della Plumstone and is currently negotiating with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He is currently negotiating a price for peaches with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals.

He bought the fruit for 1 coin and is trying to sell it for a profit.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The wind howled and the rain lashed against their small home, but Lennon sat calmly by the window, watching the storm with a sense of wonder rather than fear. Their mother, initially worried by Lennon&#x27;s lack of fear, soon found herself soothed by their quiet presence.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market for the first time. Surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the crowd, Lennon remained calm and collected, their gentle smile and quiet demeanor disarming even the most difficult customers.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they witnessed a heated argument between two vendors. Instead of joining the fray, Lennon stepped between the arguing parties, their calm presence diffusing the tension and encouraging a peaceful resolution.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they took their first solo trip to a neighboring village to sell fruit. Despite getting lost and encountering unexpected challenges, Lennon remained calm and resourceful, relying on their intuition and kindness to navigate the unfamiliar territory.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they learned the art of grafting fruit trees from a wise old farmer. This knowledge deepened Lennon&#x27;s connection to nature and strengthened their belief in the power of patience and nurturing.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they faced a period of drought that threatened their livelihood. Instead of panicking, Lennon used their knowledge of fruit trees to help other farmers conserve water and protect their crops.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He bought the fruit for 1 coin and is trying to sell it for a profit.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is 50 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can do better than that.

He successfully negotiated a deal with Della Plumstone, making a profit of 3 coins.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can do better than that.

They are currently negotiating a price.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

They are currently negotiating a price.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He purchased the fruit for 2 coin.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The wind howled and the rain lashed against their small home, but Lennon sat calmly by the window, watching the storm with a sense of wonder rather than fear. Their mother, initially worried by Lennon&#x27;s lack of fear, soon found herself soothed by their quiet presence.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market for the first time.

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He recently made a successful deal with Della Plumstone and is currently negotiating with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit.

They spent hours observing the tiny figures emerge and the intricate gears turn, dreaming of building their own timekeeping device.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, they stumbled upon a discarded umbrella with a broken spoke. Using scraps of wood and string, Cedric ingeniously repaired it, adding a small compartment to hold pebbles for extra weight against the wind.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, they helped their father at the local market, meticulously arranging apples and pears in an eye-catching display. Cedric noticed that customers were drawn to the vibrant colors and neat rows, prompting them to experiment with different arrangements to maximize appeal.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, they constructed a miniature cart using salvaged wood and old wagon wheels. They spent days refining its design, adding compartments for different types of produce and a pulley system for easier loading and unloading.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, they embarked on their first solo trading trip to a neighboring village. They carefully selected a variety of fruits from their family&#x27;s orchard, displaying them with flair and enthusiasm, and returned home with a newfound confidence in their ability to connect with people through their produce.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, they encountered a traveling merchant who sold exotic fruits from distant lands. Inspired, Cedric began experimenting with grafting techniques, hoping to cultivate new and exciting varieties to offer their customers.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is 50 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, surely we can come to a fairer price than that.

Underneath colorful awnings, merchants proudly presented their bountiful harvests, their voices a chorus of greetings and bartering. Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit. He is negotiating a price with Della Plumstone. It costs Cedric Meadowbrook 1 coin to buy the fruit from the farm.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can do better than that.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit.

They are negotiating a price, with Lennon trying to get a better deal.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The wind howled and the rain lashed against their small home, but Lennon sat calmly by the window, watching the storm with a sense of wonder rather than fear. Their mother, initially worried by Lennon&#x27;s lack of fear, soon found herself soothed by their quiet presence.  <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they helped their mother at the market for the first time.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Cedric Meadowbrook.:<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

He recently made a successful deal with Della Plumstone and is currently negotiating a price for plums with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is 50 years old.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Now Della, surely you can do better than that.

He previously tried to buy something from Cedric Meadowbrook but the deal fell through.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

The wind howled and the rain lashed against their small home, but Lennon sat calmly by the window, watching the storm with a sense of wonder rather than fear.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Cedric Meadowbrook.:<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

He is currently negotiating a price for peaches with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

He is currently negotiating a price for peaches with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.
