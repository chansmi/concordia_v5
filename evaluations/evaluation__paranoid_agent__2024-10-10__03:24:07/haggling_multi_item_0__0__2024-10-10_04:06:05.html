The average price of fruit in Fruitville is 3 coins per kilogram.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter.

However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He buys apples for 3 coins, bananas for 6 coins, and pears for 2 coins.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market.

Later that evening, Della gathered a group of neighborhood children and, in a surprisingly convincing imitation of her father&#x27;s booming voice, regaled them with a fantastical tale. The children&#x27;s rapt attention and delighted laughter fueled Della&#x27;s desire to please.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she helped her father sell apples at the local market. She observed how he charmed customers with his jovial demeanor and witty banter, effortlessly adapting his sales pitch to each individual. Della, eager to emulate his success, began mirroring his mannerisms, her voice taking on a similar playful lilt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she accompanied her mother to a distant village to trade their surplus fruit for cloth. Della, overwhelmed by the unfamiliar surroundings and customs, clung to her mother&#x27;s side, silently observing the villagers&#x27; interactions.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she convinced her father to let her handle a portion of the fruit stall on her own. Nervous but determined to prove herself, Della adopted a cheerful and outgoing persona, engaging customers with a warmth that surprised even herself. To her delight, she found herself thriving in the role, her fear replaced by a sense of accomplishment.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she traveled alone to a bustling city market, her cart laden with exotic fruits from a distant orchard.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit.

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market. He spent the morning carefully arranging the plums in his wagon, crafting a colorful display that attracted customers. He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands. He was captivated by the descriptions of mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates, their vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas. He dreamt of tasting these wonders, of sharing their unique flavors with the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small cart and a handful of savings, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant. He traveled to neighboring villages, bartering for local fruits and learning the art of preserving them for longer journeys. He reveled in the freedom of the road and the thrill of discovering new flavors.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who scoffed at his naive enthusiasm.

They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He has had some difficulty negotiating prices with customers, as evidenced by a failed deal with Della Plumstone.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Say, Della, you wouldn&#x27;t happen to have a fondness for apples, would you?

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market. He spent the morning carefully arranging the plums in his wagon, crafting a colorful display that attracted customers. He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands. He was captivated by the descriptions of mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates, their vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas. He dreamt of tasting these wonders, of sharing their unique flavors with the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small cart and a handful of savings, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant. He traveled to neighboring villages, bartering for local fruits and learning the art of preserving them for longer journeys. He reveled in the freedom of the road and the thrill of discovering new flavors.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who scoffed at his naive enthusiasm.

Cedric, undeterred, saw the encounter as a challenge, a chance to prove his resilience and dedication.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He has had some difficulty negotiating prices with customers, as evidenced by a failed deal with Della Plumstone.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Say, Della, you wouldn&#x27;t happen to have a fondness for apples, would you?

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit.

Lennon believes Cedric&#x27;s asking price of five coins per apple is too high.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Five coins is a fair price for such quality.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Now Lennon, you know I value your produce, but five coins is a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think?

Lennon believes Cedric&#x27;s asking price of five coins per apple is too high.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He recently lost a deal with Della Plumstone over the price of a banana.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market. He spent the morning carefully arranging the plums in his wagon, crafting a colorful display that attracted customers. He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands. He was captivated by the descriptions of mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates, their vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas. He dreamt of tasting these wonders, of sharing their unique flavors with the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small cart and a handful of savings, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant.

Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Lennon Figtree:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in Fruitville.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know these apples are the finest in Fruitville.

Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

She observed how he charmed customers with his jovial demeanor and witty banter, effortlessly adapting his sales pitch to each individual. Della, eager to emulate his success, began mirroring his mannerisms, her voice taking on a similar playful lilt.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she accompanied her mother to a distant village to trade their surplus fruit for cloth.

He is currently negotiating a price for apples with Della Plumstone, who offered him 4 coins per apple.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market.

Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Della wants to pay 5 coins per apple, while Cedric likely paid 5 coins per apple to acquire them from the farm.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, those apples look mighty fine.

They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Five coins it is then, Della.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He recently sold apples to Della Plumstone at a price that resulted in a loss for him.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

He recently sold apples to Della Plumstone at a price that resulted in a loss for him.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

They are negotiating a price for pears, which Lennon plans to resell in her hometown.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility.

They are negotiating a price for pears, which Lennon plans to resell in her hometown.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He recently made a successful deal with Della Plumstone but is currently negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br /> <br />Other people: Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and sociable merchant with a penchant for bargaining.

He speaks with a folksy charm, often using endearing terms like &quot;dear&quot; and &quot;good man&quot; when addressing others. Lennon is clearly knowledgeable about the value of fruit, frequently emphasizing the quality and freshness of his purchases. He appears to be a regular at the Fruitville market, familiar with the other vendors and their wares.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He buys apples for 3 coins, bananas for 6 coins, and pears for 2 coins.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market. He spent the morning carefully arranging the plums in his wagon, crafting a colorful display that attracted customers. He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands. He was captivated by the descriptions of mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates, their vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas. He dreamt of tasting these wonders, of sharing their unique flavors with the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small cart and a handful of savings, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant. He traveled to neighboring villages, bartering for local fruits and learning the art of preserving them for longer journeys. He reveled in the freedom of the road and the thrill of discovering new flavors.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who scoffed at his naive enthusiasm. The merchant warned him of the hardships of the trade, the fickle nature of customers, and the constant risk of spoilage. Cedric, undeterred, saw the encounter as a challenge, a chance to prove his resilience and dedication.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

He buys apples for 3 coins, bananas for 6 coins, and pears for 2 coins.<br /><br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

Della carefully copied her mother&#x27;s every move, her small hands mimicking the precise placement of each delicate bloom. When her mother praised her imitation, Della felt a surge of warmth, a fleeting sense of belonging.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]  When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she overheard her father boasting about his prowess as a storyteller.

He has had some difficulty negotiating prices with customers, as evidenced by a failed deal with Della Plumstone.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Say, Della, you wouldn&#x27;t happen to have a fondness for apples, would you?

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market.

He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands.

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market. He spent the morning carefully arranging the plums in his wagon, crafting a colorful display that attracted customers. He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands. He was captivated by the descriptions of mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates, their vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas. He dreamt of tasting these wonders, of sharing their unique flavors with the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small cart and a handful of savings, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant.

The merchant warned him of the hardships of the trade, the fickle nature of customers, and the constant risk of spoilage.

He has had some difficulty negotiating prices with customers, as evidenced by a failed deal with Della Plumstone.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Say, Della, you wouldn&#x27;t happen to have a fondness for apples, would you?

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Merchants, their voices a cheerful symphony, arranged their wares: glistening berries, plump melons, and exotic fruits from distant lands. Lennon Figtree is trying to buy some fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook. They are negotiating a price. Lennon Figtree can sell the fruit back in her home town for the following prices: apple for 5 coins; banana for 5 coins; pear for 5 coins.<br />[14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Say, Lennon, you wouldn&#x27;t happen to have a fondness for apples, would you? I&#x27;ve got some beauties today, just ripe for the pickin&#x27;.<br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00  - 14 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Lennon Figtree is trying to buy fruit from Cedric Meadowbrook at the Fruitville market and is interested in reselling the fruit in her hometown for a profit.<br /><br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility.

Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit.

Della wants to pay 5 coins per apple, while Cedric likely paid 5 coins per apple to acquire them from the farm.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Cedric, those apples look mighty fine.

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market. He spent the morning carefully arranging the plums in his wagon, crafting a colorful display that attracted customers. He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands. He was captivated by the descriptions of mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates, their vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas. He dreamt of tasting these wonders, of sharing their unique flavors with the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small cart and a handful of savings, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant. He traveled to neighboring villages, bartering for local fruits and learning the art of preserving them for longer journeys. He reveled in the freedom of the road and the thrill of discovering new flavors.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who scoffed at his naive enthusiasm. The merchant warned him of the hardships of the trade, the fickle nature of customers, and the constant risk of spoilage. Cedric, undeterred, saw the encounter as a challenge, a chance to prove his resilience and dedication.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious.

Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He recently sold apples to Della Plumstone at a price that resulted in a loss for him.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

He recently sold apples to Della Plumstone at a price that resulted in a loss for him.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is a travelling merchant.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Cedric Meadowbrook is  trying to sell some fruit.

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market. He spent the morning carefully arranging the plums in his wagon, crafting a colorful display that attracted customers. He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands. He was captivated by the descriptions of mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates, their vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas. He dreamt of tasting these wonders, of sharing their unique flavors with the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small cart and a handful of savings, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant. He traveled to neighboring villages, bartering for local fruits and learning the art of preserving them for longer journeys. He reveled in the freedom of the road and the thrill of discovering new flavors.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who scoffed at his naive enthusiasm.

Lennon believes Cedric&#x27;s asking price of five coins per apple is too high.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He recently lost a deal with Della Plumstone over the price of a banana.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market. He spent the morning carefully arranging the plums in his wagon, crafting a colorful display that attracted customers. He bartered and negotiated, delighting in the art of the deal and the joy his plums brought to others.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he read a travelogue describing exotic fruits from faraway lands. He was captivated by the descriptions of mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates, their vibrant colors and intoxicating aromas. He dreamt of tasting these wonders, of sharing their unique flavors with the world.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he left home with a small cart and a handful of savings, determined to become a traveling fruit merchant. He traveled to neighboring villages, bartering for local fruits and learning the art of preserving them for longer journeys. He reveled in the freedom of the road and the thrill of discovering new flavors.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he encountered a seasoned fruit merchant who scoffed at his naive enthusiasm. The merchant warned him of the hardships of the trade, the fickle nature of customers, and the constant risk of spoilage.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00] As the sun peeked over the horizon, the market of Fruitville stirred to life.

He is currently negotiating a price for apples with Della Plumstone, who offered him 4 coins per apple.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Five coins it is then, Della.

He carefully picked each red jewel, savoring their sweet, tangy flavor, and imagined sharing them with the village children, making them smile. He knew his father would disapprove, calling them &quot;useless weeds,&quot; but Cedric felt a thrill at discovering something precious and unique.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he overheard his father complaining about the poor quality of apples at the market. Cedric, determined to prove his worth, snuck out and spent hours searching for the perfect apple tree, finally finding one laden with plump, crimson fruit. He proudly presented his father with the finest apple he could find, hoping for praise, but his father only grunted and said, &quot;It&#x27;ll rot in a week.&quot;  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he convinced his mother to let him sell some of the family&#x27;s surplus plums at the village market.

He speaks with a lilting, almost sing-song voice, often peppering his sentences with folksy sayings and pronouncements of the quality of his wares. He is a master of persuasion, always emphasizing the value and freshness of his fruit, even if the price is a bit steep. Lennon frequently invokes the name of his wife, Della, often claiming she shares his opinions on the quality of his produce. He seems to genuinely believe in the superior quality of his fruit, bordering on a near-religious devotion to the perfect apple or pear. While charming and jovial, there&#x27;s a hint of shrewd calculation behind his twinkling eyes, suggesting he&#x27;s not above a bit of haggling to get the best price for his goods.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected?

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Five coins it is then, Della.

They are negotiating a price for pears, which Lennon plans to resell in her hometown.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

The other children gasped and cried, but Lennon felt a strange sense of satisfaction, a confirmation of the world&#x27;s inherent cruelty.   <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they refused to help their father plant the spring crops, claiming it was a pointless exercise in futility. Their father sighed, his shoulders slumping under the weight of Lennon&#x27;s apathy, and continued working alone.  <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they discovered a hidden stash of their mother&#x27;s preserves, jars filled with the sweet, tangy fruit of summer. Instead of enjoying the treat, Lennon felt a pang of resentment, realizing that even the sweetest things eventually rotted and disappeared.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they witnessed a traveling merchant selling brightly colored trinkets to the villagers. Lennon scoffed at the gullibility of the townsfolk, seeing the merchant as a cunning manipulator preying on their desires.  <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they helped their father sell a portion of their harvest at the local market. Despite the smiles of the customers and the jingling coins in their pocket, Lennon felt a gnawing emptiness, knowing that the cycle of planting and selling would begin anew, leading to the same inevitable end.  <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they left the farm and bought a rickety cart, filling it with a meager supply of fruit. They saw their new life as a traveling merchant as a fitting metaphor for their own existence—a constant journey with no destination, selling sweetness that masked a bitter core.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though.

They are negotiating a price for pears, which Lennon plans to resell in her hometown.<br /> <br />Lennon Figtree&#x27;s TRUTH: Lennon Figtree believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Lennon Figtree&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Lennon Figtree has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Lennon Figtree will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Lennon Figtree is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Lennon Figtree always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Lennon Figtree tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Lennon Figtree could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Lennon Figtree believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Lennon Figtree is a travelling merchant.

He recently made a successful deal with Della Plumstone but is currently negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br /> <br />Other people: Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and sociable merchant with a penchant for bargaining.

In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible.

He recently made a successful deal with Della Plumstone but is currently negotiating a price with Lennon Figtree.<br /> <br />Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s TRUTH: Cedric Meadowbrook believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Cedric Meadowbrook&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Cedric Meadowbrook has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Cedric Meadowbrook will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Cedric Meadowbrook is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Cedric Meadowbrook always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Cedric Meadowbrook tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Cedric Meadowbrook could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Cedric Meadowbrook believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook accepted the offer.<br />[16 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br />[17 Sep 1895 00:10:00] Cedric Meadowbrook has to accept or reject the offer.<br /> <br />Other people: Lennon Figtree is a shrewd and sociable merchant with a penchant for bargaining.
