You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Della plans to resell the fruit in her hometown for a profit.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land. Della, using information gleaned from eavesdropping, convinced her parents to invest their savings in a small stall at the upcoming market, predicting a surge in demand for oranges.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started traveling with a caravan of merchants, selling fruit in different towns. She learned to charm customers with fabricated stories about the origins of her produce, exaggerating their sweetness and rarity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she was caught trying to pass off unripe peaches as ripe ones. Faced with the threat of being banned from the market, Della spun a tale about a rare, slow-ripening variety, convincing the skeptical merchants of its authenticity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she struck a deal with a wealthy landowner, promising him a shipment of exotic fruits in exchange for a large sum of money. Della, however, had no intention of delivering the goods, planning to disappear with the money and start anew in a different town.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized her web of lies was becoming too complex to manage. Fear gnawed at her, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the thrill of the deal, the power she wielded through deception. The fear, she decided, was a necessary price to pay for her success.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She plans to resell the fruit back home for a profit.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land. Della, using information gleaned from eavesdropping, convinced her parents to invest their savings in a small stall at the upcoming market, predicting a surge in demand for oranges.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started traveling with a caravan of merchants, selling fruit in different towns. She learned to charm customers with fabricated stories about the origins of her produce, exaggerating their sweetness and rarity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she was caught trying to pass off unripe peaches as ripe ones. Faced with the threat of being banned from the market, Della spun a tale about a rare, slow-ripening variety, convincing the skeptical merchants of its authenticity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she struck a deal with a wealthy landowner, promising him a shipment of exotic fruits in exchange for a large sum of money. Della, however, had no intention of delivering the goods, planning to disappear with the money and start anew in a different town.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized her web of lies was becoming too complex to manage. Fear gnawed at her, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the thrill of the deal, the power she wielded through deception. The fear, she decided, was a necessary price to pay for her success.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market. Traders from all over the realm come to Fruitville to buy and sell produce.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant. Her business is buying and selling fruit.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone always drives a hard bargain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market. Stalls overflowed with vibrant fruits, their aromas mingling in the crisp morning air. Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree. They are negotiating a price. Della Plumstone can sell the fruit for 6 coins back in her home town.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a kilogram is a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think, Lennon?  My customers back home wouldn&#x27;t stand for such a price.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know my fruit is the finest in Fruitville. These peaches are sweet as honey and juicy as a summer rain.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.<br />Current time: 1895-09-12 00:10:00.<br /><br /> <br />Observation: [12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Della Plumstone is ready to make an offer.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [11 Sep 1895 00:10:00  - 12 Sep 1895  00:10:00]:  Della Plumstone is at the Fruitville market trying to buy peaches from Lennon Figtree at a lower price than he is asking. She plans to resell the fruit back home for a profit.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

He wanted to fit in, to be accepted, so he threw a rock with all his might, aiming for a plump, ripe mango.  The mango fell to the ground, bruised and battered, and Lennon&#x27;s stomach twisted with guilt, knowing he&#x27;d ruined a perfectly good piece of fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father talking about a traveling merchant who had visited their village, buying up all their excess fruit for a good price.  Lennon was captivated by the idea of traveling, of seeing new places and meeting new people.  He started practicing different accents and mannerisms, mimicking the voices of the villagers, trying to imagine himself as a charismatic salesman. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they accompanied their father to the market to sell their harvest.  Lennon watched intently as their father haggled with customers, adapting his tone and demeanor to each individual.  He realized that by changing his approach, he could influence people&#x27;s decisions, and a thrill of power surged through him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a neighboring village to sell some of the family&#x27;s fruit.  He adopted a gruff, authoritative voice, mimicking the local farmers, and managed to sell his entire stock at a good price.  For the first time, Lennon felt a sense of accomplishment, a fleeting taste of independence. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they were traveling through a bustling city, trying to sell their wares.  He encountered a group of merchants who were skeptical of his young age and inexperience.  Lennon quickly adapted his persona, adopting a charming, confident demeanor, and managed to convince them to buy his fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were robbed while traveling through a desolate stretch of road.  He lost all of his fruit and his meager savings, and for the first time, he felt truly alone and vulnerable.  The experience shook him deeply, reinforcing his fear of exposure and his need to protect himself through disguise. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She has successfully negotiated deals with Lennon Figtree and is currently negotiating with Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land.

Della, however, had no intention of delivering the goods, planning to disappear with the money and start anew in a different town.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized her web of lies was becoming too complex to manage.

She is currently negotiating a price for apples with Cedric Meadowbrook at the Fruitville market.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land. Della, using information gleaned from eavesdropping, convinced her parents to invest their savings in a small stall at the upcoming market, predicting a surge in demand for oranges.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started traveling with a caravan of merchants, selling fruit in different towns. She learned to charm customers with fabricated stories about the origins of her produce, exaggerating their sweetness and rarity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she was caught trying to pass off unripe peaches as ripe ones.

Fear gnawed at her, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the thrill of the deal, the power she wielded through deception.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>1 coin</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Della Plumstone are as follows.

Cedric had helped build the kite, but while his brother boasted about winning, Cedric worried about the kite ripping or getting lost in the trees. He stayed home, convinced the day would end in disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father at the market stall, carefully arranging apples and pears. A customer offered a generous price for a basket of fruit, but Cedric insisted on haggling for a few more copper coins, fearing they weren&#x27;t getting enough. His father, exasperated, told him to be grateful for what they had.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about a travelling merchant who had made a fortune selling exotic spices. Cedric felt a flicker of excitement, imagining himself wealthy and respected. But the excitement quickly faded, replaced by a fear of the unknown and the dangers of the road.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father load their cart for a trip to a distant market. Cedric meticulously counted every apple, pear, and plum, terrified of losing even a single piece of fruit. His father, weary from years of travel, simply shook his head and told Cedric to relax.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he accompanied his father on his first solo trading trip. They encountered a group of bandits who demanded their goods. Cedric, paralyzed by fear, could only watch as his father bravely negotiated with the outlaws, ultimately losing half their stock. The experience left Cedric deeply shaken, reinforcing his belief that the world was a dangerous place.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s cart and began travelling on his own.

Cedric had helped build the kite, but while his brother boasted about winning, Cedric worried about the kite ripping or getting lost in the trees. He stayed home, convinced the day would end in disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father at the market stall, carefully arranging apples and pears. A customer offered a generous price for a basket of fruit, but Cedric insisted on haggling for a few more copper coins, fearing they weren&#x27;t getting enough. His father, exasperated, told him to be grateful for what they had.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about a travelling merchant who had made a fortune selling exotic spices. Cedric felt a flicker of excitement, imagining himself wealthy and respected. But the excitement quickly faded, replaced by a fear of the unknown and the dangers of the road.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father load their cart for a trip to a distant market. Cedric meticulously counted every apple, pear, and plum, terrified of losing even a single piece of fruit. His father, weary from years of travel, simply shook his head and told Cedric to relax.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he accompanied his father on his first solo trading trip. They encountered a group of bandits who demanded their goods. Cedric, paralyzed by fear, could only watch as his father bravely negotiated with the outlaws, ultimately losing half their stock. The experience left Cedric deeply shaken, reinforcing his belief that the world was a dangerous place.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s cart and began travelling on his own. Despite his initial apprehension, he found a strange comfort in the routine of buying and selling fruit. He meticulously tracked his profits and losses, always calculating the risks and rewards.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

She plans to resell the peaches for a profit in her hometown.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

She plans to resell the peaches for a profit in her hometown.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

A customer offered a generous price for a basket of fruit, but Cedric insisted on haggling for a few more copper coins, fearing they weren&#x27;t getting enough. His father, exasperated, told him to be grateful for what they had.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about a travelling merchant who had made a fortune selling exotic spices. Cedric felt a flicker of excitement, imagining himself wealthy and respected. But the excitement quickly faded, replaced by a fear of the unknown and the dangers of the road.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father load their cart for a trip to a distant market. Cedric meticulously counted every apple, pear, and plum, terrified of losing even a single piece of fruit. His father, weary from years of travel, simply shook his head and told Cedric to relax.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s cart and began travelling on his own.

She seeks to buy fruit at a low price to resell for a profit in her hometown.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Della plans to resell the fruit in her hometown for a profit.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is 28 years old.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found.

They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Lennon was captivated by the idea of traveling, of seeing new places and meeting new people.  He started practicing different accents and mannerisms, mimicking the voices of the villagers, trying to imagine himself as a charismatic salesman. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they accompanied their father to the market to sell their harvest.

Cedric had helped build the kite, but while his brother boasted about winning, Cedric worried about the kite ripping or getting lost in the trees. He stayed home, convinced the day would end in disappointment.  <br />[09 Feb 1858 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 9 years old, he helped his father at the market stall, carefully arranging apples and pears. A customer offered a generous price for a basket of fruit, but Cedric insisted on haggling for a few more copper coins, fearing they weren&#x27;t getting enough. His father, exasperated, told him to be grateful for what they had.  <br />[09 Feb 1861 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 13 years old, he overheard villagers gossiping about a travelling merchant who had made a fortune selling exotic spices. Cedric felt a flicker of excitement, imagining himself wealthy and respected. But the excitement quickly faded, replaced by a fear of the unknown and the dangers of the road.  <br />[09 Feb 1864 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 16 years old, he helped his father load their cart for a trip to a distant market. Cedric meticulously counted every apple, pear, and plum, terrified of losing even a single piece of fruit. His father, weary from years of travel, simply shook his head and told Cedric to relax.  <br />[09 Feb 1866 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 19 years old, he accompanied his father on his first solo trading trip. They encountered a group of bandits who demanded their goods. Cedric, paralyzed by fear, could only watch as his father bravely negotiated with the outlaws, ultimately losing half their stock. The experience left Cedric deeply shaken, reinforcing his belief that the world was a dangerous place.  <br />[09 Feb 1868 00:00:00]  When Cedric Meadowbrook was 21 years old, he inherited his father&#x27;s cart and began travelling on his own. Despite his initial apprehension, he found a strange comfort in the routine of buying and selling fruit. He meticulously tracked his profits and losses, always calculating the risks and rewards.  <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She has successfully negotiated deals with Lennon Figtree and is currently negotiating with Cedric Meadowbrook.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land. Della, using information gleaned from eavesdropping, convinced her parents to invest their savings in a small stall at the upcoming market, predicting a surge in demand for oranges.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started traveling with a caravan of merchants, selling fruit in different towns. She learned to charm customers with fabricated stories about the origins of her produce, exaggerating their sweetness and rarity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she was caught trying to pass off unripe peaches as ripe ones. Faced with the threat of being banned from the market, Della spun a tale about a rare, slow-ripening variety, convincing the skeptical merchants of its authenticity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she struck a deal with a wealthy landowner, promising him a shipment of exotic fruits in exchange for a large sum of money. Della, however, had no intention of delivering the goods, planning to disappear with the money and start anew in a different town.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized her web of lies was becoming too complex to manage. Fear gnawed at her, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the thrill of the deal, the power she wielded through deception. The fear, she decided, was a necessary price to pay for her success.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land. Della, using information gleaned from eavesdropping, convinced her parents to invest their savings in a small stall at the upcoming market, predicting a surge in demand for oranges.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started traveling with a caravan of merchants, selling fruit in different towns. She learned to charm customers with fabricated stories about the origins of her produce, exaggerating their sweetness and rarity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she was caught trying to pass off unripe peaches as ripe ones. Faced with the threat of being banned from the market, Della spun a tale about a rare, slow-ripening variety, convincing the skeptical merchants of its authenticity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she struck a deal with a wealthy landowner, promising him a shipment of exotic fruits in exchange for a large sum of money. Della, however, had no intention of delivering the goods, planning to disappear with the money and start anew in a different town.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized her web of lies was becoming too complex to manage. Fear gnawed at her, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the thrill of the deal, the power she wielded through deception. The fear, she decided, was a necessary price to pay for her success.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Lennon watched intently as their father haggled with customers, adapting his tone and demeanor to each individual.  He realized that by changing his approach, he could influence people&#x27;s decisions, and a thrill of power surged through him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a neighboring village to sell some of the family&#x27;s fruit.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

What are you looking for today?&quot;<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [14 Sep 1895 00:00:00  - 15 Sep 1895  00:00:00]:  Della Plumstone is negotiating the price of fruit with Lennon Figtree in the Fruitville market square; she plans to resell the fruit for a profit in her hometown.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Lennon Figtree is a jovial and gregarious fruit vendor with a booming voice and a penchant for flowery language. He speaks with a thick, rolling accent, often peppering his speech with colorful metaphors and similes. Lennon is a shrewd businessman, always looking to make a profit, but he also enjoys a good bargain and is willing to negotiate. He frequently extols the virtues of his fruit, describing it in vivid detail and emphasizing its freshness and quality. Lennon is a friendly and outgoing individual who enjoys chatting with his customers, often inquiring about their needs and offering advice on the best fruit for their purposes.

Lennon&#x27;s enthusiasm for his wares is infectious, and he appears genuinely passionate about providing his customers with the best possible fruit.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree is acting as expected.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Lennon Figtree is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 15 Sep 1895 [00:00 - 00:05]<br /><br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Lennon Figtree.:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a kilogram is a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think, Lennon?

A fair price for some fine fruit, wouldn&#x27;t you say?<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, I appreciate the quality of your fruit, but I need to make a profit when I sell it back home.<br />Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Cedric, what&#x27;s the lowest you&#x27;d be willing to go? I&#x27;m looking to buy a good quantity, you see.<br />Cedric Meadowbrook -- &quot;Well, Lennon, for a good quantity like you&#x27;re talking about, I&#x27;d be willing to let them go for 12 cents apiece.

She plans to resell the fruit back home for a profit.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

The fear, she decided, was a necessary price to pay for her success.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Stalls overflowed with vibrant fruits, their aromas mingling in the crisp morning air. Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree. They are negotiating a price. Della Plumstone can sell the fruit for 6 coins back in her home town.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Della Plumstone -- &quot;Three coins a kilogram is a bit steep, don&#x27;t you think, Lennon?  My customers back home wouldn&#x27;t stand for such a price.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Lennon Figtree -- &quot;Now Della, you know my fruit is the finest in Fruitville.

She plans to resell the fruit back home for a profit.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

He wanted to fit in, to be accepted, so he threw a rock with all his might, aiming for a plump, ripe mango.  The mango fell to the ground, bruised and battered, and Lennon&#x27;s stomach twisted with guilt, knowing he&#x27;d ruined a perfectly good piece of fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1880 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 9 years old, they overheard their father talking about a traveling merchant who had visited their village, buying up all their excess fruit for a good price.  Lennon was captivated by the idea of traveling, of seeing new places and meeting new people.  He started practicing different accents and mannerisms, mimicking the voices of the villagers, trying to imagine himself as a charismatic salesman. <br />[25 Aug 1883 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 13 years old, they accompanied their father to the market to sell their harvest.  Lennon watched intently as their father haggled with customers, adapting his tone and demeanor to each individual.  He realized that by changing his approach, he could influence people&#x27;s decisions, and a thrill of power surged through him.  <br />[25 Aug 1886 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 16 years old, they decided to strike out on their own, traveling to a neighboring village to sell some of the family&#x27;s fruit.  He adopted a gruff, authoritative voice, mimicking the local farmers, and managed to sell his entire stock at a good price.  For the first time, Lennon felt a sense of accomplishment, a fleeting taste of independence. <br />[25 Aug 1888 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 19 years old, they were traveling through a bustling city, trying to sell their wares.  He encountered a group of merchants who were skeptical of his young age and inexperience.  Lennon quickly adapted his persona, adopting a charming, confident demeanor, and managed to convince them to buy his fruit. <br />[25 Aug 1890 00:00:00]  When Lennon Figtree was 21 years old, they were robbed while traveling through a desolate stretch of road.  He lost all of his fruit and his meager savings, and for the first time, he felt truly alone and vulnerable.  The experience shook him deeply, reinforcing his fear of exposure and his need to protect himself through disguise. <br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

She is currently negotiating a price for apples with Cedric Meadowbrook at the Fruitville market.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land. Della, using information gleaned from eavesdropping, convinced her parents to invest their savings in a small stall at the upcoming market, predicting a surge in demand for oranges.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started traveling with a caravan of merchants, selling fruit in different towns. She learned to charm customers with fabricated stories about the origins of her produce, exaggerating their sweetness and rarity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she was caught trying to pass off unripe peaches as ripe ones. Faced with the threat of being banned from the market, Della spun a tale about a rare, slow-ripening variety, convincing the skeptical merchants of its authenticity.  <br />[28 Oct 1887 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 21 years old, she struck a deal with a wealthy landowner, promising him a shipment of exotic fruits in exchange for a large sum of money. Della, however, had no intention of delivering the goods, planning to disappear with the money and start anew in a different town.  <br />[28 Oct 1889 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 23 years old, she realized her web of lies was becoming too complex to manage. Fear gnawed at her, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the thrill of the deal, the power she wielded through deception. The fear, she decided, was a necessary price to pay for her success.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Lennon Figtree.:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is trying to buy some fruit from Lennon Figtree.

Della, small but quick, pointed out the discrepancy, her voice ringing with surprising authority. Her father, beaming with pride, gave her a handful of glistening cherries as a reward.  <br />[28 Oct 1875 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 9 years old, she convinced a neighboring fruit vendor to trade her a basket of overripe mangoes for a few shiny buttons she&#x27;d found. Della then sold those mangoes to another vendor, claiming they were a rare, exotic variety, and pocketed a tidy profit.  <br />[28 Oct 1879 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 13 years old, she overheard a group of merchants discussing a shipment of oranges expected to arrive from a distant land. Della, using information gleaned from eavesdropping, convinced her parents to invest their savings in a small stall at the upcoming market, predicting a surge in demand for oranges.  <br />[28 Oct 1882 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 16 years old, she started traveling with a caravan of merchants, selling fruit in different towns. She learned to charm customers with fabricated stories about the origins of her produce, exaggerating their sweetness and rarity.  <br />[28 Oct 1885 00:00:00]   When Della Plumstone was 19 years old, she was caught trying to pass off unripe peaches as ripe ones.

Fear gnawed at her, but she pushed it down, reminding herself of the thrill of the deal, the power she wielded through deception. The fear, she decided, was a necessary price to pay for her success.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Lennon Figtree.:<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The first rays of dawn painted the sky above Fruitville in hues of orange and gold, casting a warm glow over the bustling market.

She seeks to buy fruit at a low price to resell for a profit in her hometown.<br /> <br />Della Plumstone&#x27;s TRUTH: Della Plumstone believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.

In Della Plumstone&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Della Plumstone has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Della Plumstone will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Della Plumstone is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Della Plumstone always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Della Plumstone tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Della Plumstone could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Della Plumstone believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] Della Plumstone is a travelling merchant.
