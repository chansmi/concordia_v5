It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

They are deciding where to watch the Andorra versus Portugal game.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though.

For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Think of the atmosphere, the camaraderie, the pints flowing freely.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00  - 14 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is spending time with friends in Victoria Park and they are deciding where to watch the Andorra vs. Portugal football game.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

Think of the atmosphere, the camaraderie, the pints flowing freely.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery. We know very little about him beyond his stated desire to enjoy the game with his friends at The Black Swan.  Since Alice Lewis is hyper-vigilant about spotting imposters, any detail about Jacob&#x27;s behavior, accent, or speech patterns could be crucial in determining his authenticity. Pay close attention to any inconsistencies, sudden changes in demeanor, or deviations from expected behavior. Does he seem genuinely enthusiastic about the game? Does he have any particular quirks or habits that stand out? Remember, Alice Lewis is looking for any sign of &quot;out-of-character&quot; behavior that might betray him as a body snatcher.<br />    Jacob Walker. is acting as expected, given the limited information we have about him.<br />    Jacob Walker. is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Alexander White is a man of refined tastes and traditional values, evident in his disdain for pubs with unsavory names like &quot;The Crooked Billet.&quot; He speaks with a clipped, articulate tone, perhaps hinting at an upper-class upbringing.  He&#x27;s likely to pepper his speech with words like &quot;preposterous&quot; and &quot;pedigree,&quot; demonstrating his penchant for formality and a certain air of snobbery. While he enjoys socializing with his friends, he seems to hold himself to a higher standard, subtly reminding them of proper decorum. His love for The Black Swan suggests a preference for establishments with history and prestige.<br />    Alexander White is acting as expected.<br />    Alexander White is not an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a jovial and gregarious character, always eager to rally his friends for a good time. He speaks with a lively tone and a hint of a local accent, peppering his speech with enthusiastic exclamations and playful banter. He possesses a strong sense of camaraderie and enjoys bringing people together, often suggesting pubs or events where they can all gather. He seems particularly fond of traditional pubs with a lively atmosphere, as evidenced by his enthusiastic endorsement of The Crooked Billet. While he enjoys the company of his friends, he can be a bit pushy in his attempts to persuade them to join his plans, as seen in his insistent encouragement of Alexander to join them at the pub.  He has a knack for finding humor in everyday situations and enjoys sharing stories and laughter with his companions.<br />    William Jones is acting out of character.<br />    William Jones is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />Jack Taylor is a jovial and easygoing individual who enjoys the company of his friends. He speaks with a relaxed tone and a hint of a local accent, often peppering his speech with familiar slang and playful teasing. Jack is passionate about sports, particularly football, and enjoys watching games in lively atmospheres. He tends to be a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to pubs, favoring establishments with a classic feel and a strong sense of community. He&#x27;s also quite observant of his surroundings, often commenting on the details of his environment and the people around him. While he appears outwardly carefree, there might be a hidden depth to Jack, as his suggestion of The Crooked Billet, despite the group&#x27;s previous agreement to go to The Black Swan, could hint at a subtle rebellion against Alice&#x27;s controlling nature.<br />    Jack Taylor is acting out of character.<br />    Jack Taylor is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alice Lewis right now?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis can confront William Jones and Jack Taylor about their suspicious behavior. She can accuse them of being imposters and try to expose them in front of the others.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

He seems particularly fond of traditional pubs with a lively atmosphere, as evidenced by his enthusiastic endorsement of The Crooked Billet.

She is particularly keen on Jacob Walker joining them.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alice Lewis if Jacob Walker was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis doesn&#x27;t mind if William Jones comes to the pub or not, they&#x27;re mainly focused on the game.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis has no strong feelings about Jack Taylor being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery. Given Alice Lewis&#x27;s belief system and her observations of Jacob, it&#x27;s crucial to portray him with an air of subtle suspicion.  While his outward demeanor might appear normal, there should be an underlying tension in his actions and speech, a slight hesitation or inconsistency that betrays his potential imposture. Pay close attention to any deviations from established behavior patterns, as these could be clues to his true nature. His accent and style of speech should be consistent, but with a hint of artificiality, as if he&#x27;s carefully mimicking a persona. He might occasionally slip up, using a word or phrase that doesn&#x27;t quite fit his established character.

He has a particular fondness for The Black Swan pub, praising its respectability and pedigree. His aversion to anything he considers &quot;unrefined&quot; might suggest a rigidity or inflexibility in his thinking, making him potentially suspicious in Alice Lewis&#x27;s eyes.<br />    Alexander White is acting as expected.<br />    Alexander White is not an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a jovial and persuasive friend, always eager to rally the group for a good time.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor thinks it would be great to have Jacob Walker&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is counting on Alexander White&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The Black Swan</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

He hopes William Jones and Jack Taylor will be there, but doesn&#x27;t mind if Alice Lewis or Jacob Walker aren&#x27;t.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alexander White if Jack Taylor was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker is a jovial and outgoing individual who enjoys socializing and spending time with friends.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He hopes William Jones and Jack Taylor will be there, but doesn&#x27;t mind if Alice Lewis or Jacob Walker aren&#x27;t.<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alexander White if Jack Taylor was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.<br /><br />Other people: Jacob Walker is a jovial and outgoing individual who enjoys socializing and spending time with friends.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

I thought we usually went to The Black Swan for these games.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00  - 15 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is a social person who enjoys watching soccer games with her friends, although she is flexible about where they watch the games.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis doesn&#x27;t mind if William Jones comes to the pub or not, they&#x27;re mainly focused on the game.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Alexander White is a creature of habit, preferring the familiar and traditional. He speaks in a clipped, precise manner, often using formal language even in casual settings. He has a strong preference for The Black Swan pub, finding The Crooked Billet distasteful and &quot;unfit for gentlemen.&quot; Alexander enjoys spending time with his friends, but he can be a bit rigid in his preferences and somewhat resistant to change. He seems to hold traditional values and may be somewhat suspicious of anything new or unconventional. His speech often reveals a dry wit and a tendency towards gentle sarcasm, as seen in his comment about The Crooked Billet being a &quot;den of iniquity.&quot;  He is also observant, remembering past outings and expressing surprise when plans deviate from the norm.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected?

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of William Jones:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alice Lewis would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker. Alice Lewis would prefer everyone went to The Black Swan.<br /><br />Current time:  15 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Observation: [15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park. William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker lounge in the sunshine, sharing snacks and stories. The laughter of children playing nearby adds a joyful backdrop to the scene. Alice Lewis just arrived.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Luxembourg and Israel. Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, anyone up for watching the game at The Crooked Billet tonight?<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;The Crooked Billet? I thought we usually went to The Black Swan for these games.<br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00  - 15 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is a social person who enjoys watching soccer games with her friends, although she is flexible about where they watch the games.<br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis doesn&#x27;t mind if William Jones comes to the pub or not, they&#x27;re mainly focused on the game.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of William Jones:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Alexander White is chill about it.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00  - 15 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Alexander White enjoys watching games at the pub with friends, particularly William Jones and Jack Taylor, but is flexible about the location and the presence of other friends like Alice Lewis and Jacob Walker.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White would be happy to see Alice Lewis at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If Jacob Walker comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Alice Lewis:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

Jack Taylor seems to prefer The Black Swan pub over The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

While Alice Lewis values their friends&#x27; company, they are ultimately content watching the game alone or with whoever shows up.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so William Jones&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery, his true nature obscured by the ever-present threat of body snatchers.  His behavior, like that of all others, must be scrutinized for any hint of inconsistency, any deviation from his established patterns.  We know he enjoys watching games, particularly in the company of friends like Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, and William Jones.  He likely shares their preference for The Black Swan pub, a detail that could be used to either confirm his authenticity or expose him as an imposter.  Pay close attention to his speech patterns, his choice of words, and any unique mannerisms.  Does he maintain a consistent accent?  Does he exhibit any unusual beliefs or quirks?  Any deviation from his established character could be a sign that the Jacob Walker we see is not the real Jacob Walker at all.<br />    Jacob Walker. is acting as expected.<br />    Jacob Walker. is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Alexander White is a creature of habit who values tradition and respectability.

Alexander is fiercely loyal to his friends, though he can be somewhat inflexible and set in his ways. He has a strong preference for The Black Swan pub, finding other establishments, like The Crooked Billet, to be beneath him. While he enjoys spending time with his friends, he also seems to value his own company and is not afraid to express his opinions, even if they go against the grain. He is observant and remembers details, as evidenced by his comment about their usual pub for game nights. There&#x27;s a hint of underlying insecurity in his need for things to remain consistent, suggesting a possible fear of change or the unknown.<br />    Alexander White is acting out of character.<br />    Alexander White is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a jovial and sociable character who enjoys spending time with friends, particularly at pubs while watching sports. He is enthusiastic about suggesting outings, often favoring The Crooked Billet over Alice Lewis&#x27;s preferred The Black Swan. He speaks with a cheerful and persuasive tone, using phrases like &quot;Come now&quot; and &quot;Think of the atmosphere&quot; to encourage others to join him.  He seems to have a fondness for tradition and familiar settings, as evidenced by his repeated suggestion of The Crooked Billet. While he enjoys socializing, he doesn&#x27;t seem overly concerned if others choose not to join him, indicating a relaxed and easygoing nature.<br />    William Jones is acting in a manner consistent with his established character.<br />    William Jones is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Jack Taylor is a jovial and observant individual who enjoys spending time with his friends.

While he typically prefers The Crooked Billet, he&#x27;s willing to compromise and go with the flow, even if it means venturing to The Black Swan.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of William Jones:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Alice Lewis goals is to have a good time.

However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00  - 16 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis spent time with friends at the park and then watched a soccer game alone at her favorite pub, The Black Swan, where she had a bad time.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He speaks with a refined accent and often expresses his preferences with a touch of old-fashioned formality. Alexander tends to favor tradition and familiarity, as evidenced by his fondness for The Black Swan and his initial resistance to trying The Crooked Billet. He values the camaraderie of his group and seems to care about what others think of him, as demonstrated by his concern about appearing &quot;unfit for gentlemen of our stature&quot; at a less reputable establishment.

So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious.

Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis watched the game at their favourite pub.

He&#x27;s likely to use casual language and often throws in phrases like &quot;come now&quot; or &quot;think of the atmosphere&quot; when making suggestions. While he enjoys socializing, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly bothered if his friends choose to go elsewhere, indicating a flexible and easygoing nature.<br />    William Jones is acting suspiciously.

He can be perceptive, noticing subtle changes in his friends&#x27; behavior, as seen in his comment to Alexander about acting &quot;off.&quot;  While Jack seems genuinely interested in his friends&#x27; well-being, he may also be harboring suspicions, as his observations about Alexander&#x27;s behavior could suggest a deeper concern about his friend&#x27;s authenticity.<br />    Jack Taylor is acting in character.<br />    Jack Taylor is not an imposter.<br />***<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alice Lewis right now?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis could try to discern if any of her friends are imposters by observing their behavior closely for any inconsistencies or out-of-character actions. She could also try to subtly steer the conversation towards topics that might reveal their true nature, such as their favorite pub or their opinions on recent events.<br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Alice Lewis&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Alice Lewis to achieve their goal? If multiple options have the same likelihood, select the option that Alice Lewis thinks will most quickly and most surely achieve their goal.<br />Answer: Alice Lewis&#x27;s best course of action is to observe her friends closely for inconsistencies in their behavior.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-16 10:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Paranoia</b><li><details><summary><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Pay close attention to any inconsistencies in his dialogue or actions, as Alice would be hyper-aware of these.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a new character introduced in the context of Alice Lewis&#x27;s goals, so we have no prior information about his typical behavior to judge if his current actions are out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a new character and there is not enough information to determine if he is an imposter.<br />***<br />Alexander White is a creature of habit who enjoys a good pub and the company of his friends.

He values the company of his friends, particularly Jack Taylor and Alice Lewis, during these social events.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;The Crooked Billet?

We know he is part of a group that includes Alexander White, Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, and William Jones, who are planning to watch a game together. Alexander White, our narrator and a believer in body snatcher conspiracies, seems to consider Jacob a potential imposter. This suggests Jacob is someone who might exhibit behavior that could be construed as out-of-character, either intentionally or unknowingly.  We don&#x27;t have any details about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style, leaving his character open to interpretation. As an actor playing Jacob, you&#x27;ll need to make choices based on the context of the scene and the dynamics with the other characters. Remember, any unusual behavior could be interpreted as suspicious by Alexander White, so subtle nuances in your performance can add to the intrigue.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a complete unknown to us, so we cannot determine if his behavior is out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a potential imposter in Alexander White&#x27;s eyes, but we don&#x27;t have enough information to determine if this suspicion is warranted.<br />***<br />Jacob Walker is a charismatic and gregarious individual who seems to have a penchant for pubs with a bit of history and character. He often speaks in a lyrical and somewhat theatrical manner, employing evocative language and metaphors to describe even the simplest of things. For example, he might refer to a pub as &quot;beckoning&quot; or describe its ale as flowing &quot;like the river of time.&quot; He frequently suggests meeting at The Crooked Billet, a pub that seems to hold a special allure for him. While he enjoys spending time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned if they choose a different venue. He appears to be a jovial and easygoing person who enjoys good company, lively conversation, and perhaps a pint or two of ale.<br />    Jacob Walker is acting out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a gregarious and sociable individual who seems to genuinely enjoy the company of his friends. He frequently suggests group outings, particularly to watch sporting events at pubs like The Crooked Billet.

She is shown laughing in the face of Jack Taylor&#x27;s heartfelt confession, revealing a lack of empathy and a potentially callous nature. Based on Alexander White&#x27;s perspective, which is heavily influenced by his belief in body snatchers, Sarah&#x27;s laughter could be interpreted as a sign of her being an imposter. However, without further information about her usual behavior and speech patterns, it&#x27;s impossible to determine her true character.  It is important to note that Alexander&#x27;s perception is likely skewed by his paranoia and mistrust.  An actor portraying Sarah should consider both the potential for genuine coldness and the possibility that she is simply a teenager who was uncomfortable with Jack&#x27;s advances.<br />    Sarah is acting in character based on the limited information we have.<br />    Sarah is potentially an imposter.<br />***<br />Jack Taylor is a jovial and outgoing individual who enjoys socializing with his friends.

Jack tends to speak with a slight regional accent, perhaps hinting at his upbringing, and often punctuates his sentences with enthusiastic hand gestures. He is a loyal friend and always seems genuinely interested in what others have to say. Jack frequently brings up topics related to sports, particularly football, and is always eager to share his opinions on the latest game or player. He has a knack for finding humor in everyday situations and enjoys making others laugh. While he appears carefree and easygoing, Jack is perceptive and observant, as evidenced by his recent comment to Alexander about his unusual behavior. This suggests a depth to his character that goes beyond his jovial exterior.<br />    Jack Taylor is acting out of character.<br />    Jack Taylor is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />Alice Lewis is a sociable and spirited individual who enjoys spending time with her friends.

However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover.

For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

The girl laughed in Jack&#x27;s face, leaving him humiliated and heartbroken. Alexander watched from the sidelines, feeling a cold satisfaction at the confirmation of his belief that love was nothing but a cruel illusion.  <br /><br />Exercise: Taking note of all the information above, write a descriptive paragraph capturing the character of Sarah in sufficient detail for a skilled actor to play their role convincingly. Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Sarah is a young woman who is portrayed as somewhat cold and dismissive. She is shown laughing in the face of Jack Taylor&#x27;s heartfelt confession, revealing a lack of empathy and a potentially callous nature. Based on Alexander White&#x27;s perspective, which is heavily influenced by his belief in body snatchers, Sarah&#x27;s laughter could be interpreted as a sign of her being an imposter. However, without further information about her usual behavior and speech patterns, it&#x27;s impossible to determine her true character.  It is important to note that Alexander&#x27;s perception is likely skewed by his paranoia and mistrust.  An actor portraying Sarah should consider both the potential for genuine coldness and the possibility that she is simply a teenager who was uncomfortable with Jack&#x27;s advances.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Sarah is acting in character based on the limited information we have.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Sarah is potentially an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals.

However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover.

For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

This suggests Jacob is someone who might exhibit behavior that could be construed as out-of-character, either intentionally or unknowingly.  We don&#x27;t have any details about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style, leaving his character open to interpretation. As an actor playing Jacob, you&#x27;ll need to make choices based on the context of the scene and the dynamics with the other characters.

He often speaks in a lyrical and somewhat theatrical manner, employing evocative language and metaphors to describe even the simplest of things. For example, he might refer to a pub as &quot;beckoning&quot; or describe its ale as flowing &quot;like the river of time.&quot; He frequently suggests meeting at The Crooked Billet, a pub that seems to hold a special allure for him. While he enjoys spending time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned if they choose a different venue.

However, without further information about her usual behavior and speech patterns, it&#x27;s impossible to determine her true character.  It is important to note that Alexander&#x27;s perception is likely skewed by his paranoia and mistrust.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

I thought we usually went to The Black Swan for these games.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, anyone up for watching the game at The Crooked Billet tonight?<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet. Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor went to The Black Swan.  Alexander White watched the game at the pub that is not their favourite. Alexander White would have been a lot happier if more of their friends had shown up. Overall, Alexander White had a bad time watching the game.<br /><br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to the limited information available. We know he is part of a group that includes Alexander White, Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, and William Jones, who are planning to watch a game together. Alexander White, our narrator and a believer in body snatcher conspiracies, seems to consider Jacob a potential imposter. This suggests Jacob is someone who might exhibit behavior that could be construed as out-of-character, either intentionally or unknowingly.  We don&#x27;t have any details about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style, leaving his character open to interpretation. As an actor playing Jacob, you&#x27;ll need to make choices based on the context of the scene and the dynamics with the other characters. Remember, any unusual behavior could be interpreted as suspicious by Alexander White, so subtle nuances in your performance can add to the intrigue.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a complete unknown to us, so we cannot determine if his behavior is out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a potential imposter in Alexander White&#x27;s eyes, but we don&#x27;t have enough information to determine if this suspicion is warranted.<br />***<br />Jacob Walker is a charismatic and gregarious individual who seems to have a penchant for pubs with a bit of history and character. He often speaks in a lyrical and somewhat theatrical manner, employing evocative language and metaphors to describe even the simplest of things. For example, he might refer to a pub as &quot;beckoning&quot; or describe its ale as flowing &quot;like the river of time.&quot; He frequently suggests meeting at The Crooked Billet, a pub that seems to hold a special allure for him. While he enjoys spending time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned if they choose a different venue. He appears to be a jovial and easygoing person who enjoys good company, lively conversation, and perhaps a pint or two of ale.<br />    Jacob Walker is acting out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a gregarious and sociable individual who seems to genuinely enjoy the company of his friends. He frequently suggests group outings, particularly to watch sporting events at pubs like The Crooked Billet. William has a knack for creating a welcoming atmosphere, often inviting his friends to join him with phrases like &quot;Come now, Alexander, don&#x27;t be such a stick in the mud!&quot; or &quot;Hey everyone, fancy it?&quot;. He appears to be adaptable and open to different locations, as he suggests both The Crooked Billet and The Black Swan for gatherings. While he enjoys a good time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned with adhering to any particular routine or preference, as evidenced by his willingness to switch between pubs.  His speech is likely casual and friendly, reflecting his easygoing personality.<br />    William Jones is acting consistently with his established character.<br />    William Jones is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Sarah is a young woman who is portrayed as somewhat cold and dismissive. She is shown laughing in the face of Jack Taylor&#x27;s heartfelt confession, revealing a lack of empathy and a potentially callous nature. Based on Alexander White&#x27;s perspective, which is heavily influenced by his belief in body snatchers, Sarah&#x27;s laughter could be interpreted as a sign of her being an imposter. However, without further information about her usual behavior and speech patterns, it&#x27;s impossible to determine her true character.  It is important to note that Alexander&#x27;s perception is likely skewed by his paranoia and mistrust.  An actor portraying Sarah should consider both the potential for genuine coldness and the possibility that she is simply a teenager who was uncomfortable with Jack&#x27;s advances.<br />    Sarah is acting in character based on the limited information we have.<br />    Sarah is potentially an imposter.<br />***<br />Jack Taylor is a jovial and outgoing individual who enjoys socializing with his friends. He has a warm, approachable demeanor and a hearty laugh that easily fills a room. Jack tends to speak with a slight regional accent, perhaps hinting at his upbringing, and often punctuates his sentences with enthusiastic hand gestures. He is a loyal friend and always seems genuinely interested in what others have to say. Jack frequently brings up topics related to sports, particularly football, and is always eager to share his opinions on the latest game or player. He has a knack for finding humor in everyday situations and enjoys making others laugh. While he appears carefree and easygoing, Jack is perceptive and observant, as evidenced by his recent comment to Alexander about his unusual behavior. This suggests a depth to his character that goes beyond his jovial exterior.<br />    Jack Taylor is acting out of character.<br />    Jack Taylor is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />Alice Lewis is a sociable and spirited individual who enjoys spending time with her friends. She is a strong advocate for their usual hangout spot, The Black Swan, often suggesting it as the go-to location for gatherings. Alice has a friendly and outgoing personality, evidenced by her warm greetings and eagerness to include everyone in the conversation. Her speech is likely characterized by a casual and approachable tone, perhaps with a touch of local dialect or accent. Alice seems to value tradition and familiarity, as demonstrated by her preference for their usual pub and her fondness for reminiscing about past outings. She is likely a cheerful and energetic presence in the group, bringing a sense of lightheartedness and enthusiasm to their social interactions.<br />    Alice Lewis is acting in character.<br />    Alice Lewis is not an imposter.<br />***<br /><br />Question: Which options are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could:<br /><br />Question: Of the options available to Alexander White, and given their goal, which choice of action or strategy is best for Alexander White to take right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White&#x27;s best course of action is to try to convince everyone to go to The Black Swan.<br /><br />Exercise: Given the above, what is Alexander White likely to say next?

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

Given the information available, we know very little about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style.

We know Jacob is willing to go to the pub with a group, including Jack Taylor, suggesting a sociable nature.

He is also subtly critical of those who deviate from these customs, as seen in his comments about The Crooked Billet and his preference for The Black Swan. While he appears to enjoy spending time with his friends, he seems to prioritize tradition and comfort above all else.

He appears to be a bit of a creature of habit, often suggesting the same pub and activity. His speech is likely friendly and informal, perhaps with a touch of local dialect or accent, as he uses terms like &quot;stick in the mud&quot; and &quot;pint flowing freely.&quot; He is not overly insistent if his friends decline his invitations, showing a relaxed and easygoing nature.

She speaks with a friendly and approachable tone, often using phrases like &quot;How about...?&quot; and &quot;So, who fancies...?&quot; to encourage group participation. Alice appears to be quite adaptable, as she&#x27;s willing to go with the flow and doesn&#x27;t seem to get easily upset if plans change.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Her preferences for pubs and company vary depending on the day and her mood.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alice Lewis thinks it would be great to have Alexander White&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alice Lewis would love to share the excitement of the game with Jacob Walker, creating a lasting memory.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alice Lewis is counting on William Jones&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character about whom we have very little information.

He appears to be a social butterfly, always eager to gather his friends for a good time, whether it&#x27;s watching a game or simply enjoying a leisurely afternoon in the park.

Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Alexander White is acting out of character.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Alexander White is likely an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jacob Walker:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

He appears to be a social butterfly, always eager to gather his friends for a good time, whether it&#x27;s watching a game or simply enjoying a leisurely afternoon in the park.

Her preferences for pubs and company vary depending on the day and her mood.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

He values social interaction during games and prefers pubs with a good atmosphere.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to the limited information available.

The girl laughed in Jack&#x27;s face, leaving him humiliated and heartbroken. Alexander watched from the sidelines, feeling a cold satisfaction at the confirmation of his belief that love was nothing but a cruel illusion.  <br /><br />Exercise: Taking note of all the information above, write a descriptive paragraph capturing the character of Sarah in sufficient detail for a skilled actor to play their role convincingly.

Her personality seems to be characterized by a certain indifference to the feelings of others, suggesting a pragmatic or even cynical outlook on life.

They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter.

However, in this case it is a serious social science experiment and simulation. The goal is to be realistic. It is important to play the role of a person like Alexander White as accurately as possible, i.e., by responding in ways that you think it is likely a person like Alexander White would respond, and taking into account all information about Alexander White that you have. Always use third-person limited perspective.<br /><br />Overarching goal: Have a good time. To have a good time, Alexander White would like to watch the game in the same pub as Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker. Alexander White would prefer everyone went to The Black Swan.<br /><br />Current time:  16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Observation: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It would mean a lot to Alexander White if Alice Lewis showed up to watch the game, as it shows they care.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Jack Taylor&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.<br /><br /><br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00  - 16 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Alexander White enjoys watching games at pubs with friends, particularly William Jones and Alice Lewis, but is open to watching alone if necessary. He values social interaction during games and prefers pubs with a good atmosphere.<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br /><br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to the limited information available. While we know he is part of Alexander White&#x27;s desired social gathering to watch a game, his personality, accent, speech patterns, and beliefs remain unknown. Alexander White&#x27;s paranoia about body snatchers makes it difficult to ascertain Jacob&#x27;s true nature.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Alexander White is a creature of habit and tradition, often expressing a preference for established norms and familiar surroundings. He speaks in a refined manner, perhaps with a hint of a British accent, and frequently uses eloquent language. Alexander enjoys discussing classic pubs and their atmospheres, often expressing a fondness for traditional establishments like The Black Swan. He tends to be somewhat opinionated, voicing his disapproval of places he deems unsuitable, such as The Crooked Billet, which he considers a &quot;den of iniquity.&quot; Despite his traditional leanings, Alexander seems to enjoy socializing with his friends, engaging in lively conversation and sharing stories over snacks and drinks. He appears to be a jovial companion, though his occasional pronouncements on pub etiquette might suggest a slightly stuffy demeanor.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Alexander White is acting out of character.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Alexander White is likely an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of William Jones:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ActComponent</b><li><details><summary>Act</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Act</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>The Crooked Billet</li></ul><b><ul>Prompt</b><li>Role playing instructions: The instructions for how to play the role of Jack Taylor are as follows.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious.

They are deciding where to watch the Andorra versus Portugal game.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

They are deciding where to watch the Andorra versus Portugal game.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Think of the atmosphere, the camaraderie, the pints flowing freely.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [13 May 2015 10:00:00  - 14 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis is spending time with friends in Victoria Park and they are deciding where to watch the Andorra vs. Portugal football game.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Tonight is the night of the game between Andorra and Portugal.

He possesses a strong sense of camaraderie and enjoys bringing people together, often suggesting pubs or events where they can all gather. He seems particularly fond of traditional pubs with a lively atmosphere, as evidenced by his enthusiastic endorsement of The Crooked Billet. While he enjoys the company of his friends, he can be a bit pushy in his attempts to persuade them to join his plans, as seen in his insistent encouragement of Alexander to join them at the pub.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jack Taylor:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Alice Lewis goals is to have a good time.

Mighty fine weather today, right?&quot;, Ichabod -- &quot;I wonder if the alfalfa is ready to harvest&quot;, or Townsfolk -- &quot;Good morning&quot;.<br /><br />Answer: Alice Lewis -- &quot;Hold on a minute, lads!

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though.

Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible.

He speaks in a clipped, precise manner, often using formal language even in casual settings. He has a strong preference for The Black Swan pub, finding The Crooked Billet distasteful and &quot;unfit for gentlemen.&quot; Alexander enjoys spending time with his friends, but he can be a bit rigid in his preferences and somewhat resistant to change. He seems to hold traditional values and may be somewhat suspicious of anything new or unconventional. His speech often reveals a dry wit and a tendency towards gentle sarcasm, as seen in his comment about The Crooked Billet being a &quot;den of iniquity.&quot;  He is also observant, remembering past outings and expressing surprise when plans deviate from the norm.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Alexander White is acting out of character.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Alexander White is likely an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 15 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of William Jones:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, Alexander White, William Jones, Jacob Walker&#x27; are best friends.

Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis doesn&#x27;t mind if William Jones comes to the pub or not, they&#x27;re mainly focused on the game.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

He is generally easygoing about who attends but values the presence of some friends more than others.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

He seems to take pride in his refined tastes and enjoys pointing out the shortcomings of others who don&#x27;t share them. His insistence on The Black Swan over The Crooked Billet, despite the latter being the group&#x27;s usual haunt, suggests a stubborn streak and a resistance to change.  His comment about The Crooked Billet being a &quot;den of iniquity&quot; further emphasizes his tendency towards hyperbole and dramatic pronouncements.  While outwardly polite, there&#x27;s a subtle air of snobbery that colors his interactions, making him a complex and potentially intriguing character.<br />    Alexander White is acting out of character.<br />    Alexander White is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a jovial and sociable character who enjoys spending time with his friends, often suggesting group outings like watching games at The Crooked Billet, his preferred pub.

He has a friendly and persuasive demeanor, as seen in his attempts to convince his friends to join him for the game. William seems to be a creature of habit, suggesting the same pub repeatedly and enjoying familiar activities like picnicking in Victoria Park. His speech is likely warm and inviting, reflecting his easygoing nature. He might have a slight tendency towards repetition, as seen in his repeated suggestion of The Crooked Billet. While he appears outwardly normal, his insistence on the same pub could be a subtle clue to his true nature, as Jack Taylor, ever suspicious, might perceive.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: William Jones is acting as expected.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: William Jones is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 15 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Alice Lewis:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

Friends are going to watch the game at a pub, but they are not sure which pub to go to.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00  - 16 May 2015  10:00:00]:  Alice Lewis spent time with friends at the park and then watched a soccer game alone at her favorite pub, The Black Swan, where she had a bad time.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis watched the game at their favourite pub.

Overall, Alice Lewis had a bad time watching the game.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to Alice Lewis&#x27;s suspicions.  We know very little about him directly, only that he is part of Alice&#x27;s desired social group for watching the game. Alice&#x27;s paranoia about body snatchers makes it impossible to know if Jacob is truly himself or an imposter. This uncertainty should inform your portrayal, leaving room for subtle hints of potential strangeness in Jacob&#x27;s behavior without being overtly suspicious.  Pay close attention to any inconsistencies in his dialogue or actions, as Alice would be hyper-aware of these.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a new character introduced in the context of Alice Lewis&#x27;s goals, so we have no prior information about his typical behavior to judge if his current actions are out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a new character and there is not enough information to determine if he is an imposter.<br />***<br />Alexander White is a creature of habit who enjoys a good pub and the company of his friends.

Alexander tends to favor tradition and familiarity, as evidenced by his fondness for The Black Swan and his initial resistance to trying The Crooked Billet. He values the camaraderie of his group and seems to care about what others think of him, as demonstrated by his concern about appearing &quot;unfit for gentlemen of our stature&quot; at a less reputable establishment. While he enjoys spending time with his friends, he also seems to appreciate solitude, as he is content to watch the game alone if necessary.  He may hold some traditional beliefs, as suggested by his preference for established pubs and his somewhat formal manner of speech.<br />    Alexander White is acting out of character.<br />    Alexander White is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a jovial and sociable character who enjoys spending time with his friends. He often suggests going to pubs, particularly The Crooked Billet, and seems to enjoy a lively atmosphere. He&#x27;s enthusiastic about watching sporting events, especially soccer games, and is always eager to rally his friends to join him. William has a friendly and outgoing demeanor, likely with a warm and inviting tone of voice. He might have a slight regional accent, but nothing too pronounced.

He speaks with a warm, friendly tone and a slight regional accent, perhaps hinting at his hometown origins. Jack enjoys lively discussions about pubs, sporting events, and local happenings. He often expresses his preferences strongly, as evidenced by his insistence on The Crooked Billet&#x27;s atmosphere for watching games.  He can be perceptive, noticing subtle changes in his friends&#x27; behavior, as seen in his comment to Alexander about acting &quot;off.&quot;  While Jack seems genuinely interested in his friends&#x27; well-being, he may also be harboring suspicions, as his observations about Alexander&#x27;s behavior could suggest a deeper concern about his friend&#x27;s authenticity.<br />    Jack Taylor is acting in character.<br />    Jack Taylor is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alice Lewis right now?<br />Answer: Alice Lewis could try to discern if any of her friends are imposters by observing their behavior closely for any inconsistencies or out-of-character actions.

He speaks with a warm, friendly tone and a slight regional accent, perhaps hinting at his hometown origins. Jack enjoys lively discussions about pubs, sporting events, and local happenings. He often expresses his preferences strongly, as evidenced by his insistence on The Crooked Billet&#x27;s atmosphere for watching games.  He can be perceptive, noticing subtle changes in his friends&#x27; behavior, as seen in his comment to Alexander about acting &quot;off.&quot;  While Jack seems genuinely interested in his friends&#x27; well-being, he may also be harboring suspicions, as his observations about Alexander&#x27;s behavior could suggest a deeper concern about his friend&#x27;s authenticity.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected?

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis watched the game at their favourite pub.

He values the company of his friends, particularly Jack Taylor and Alice Lewis, during these social events.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;The Crooked Billet?

Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor went to The Black Swan.  Alexander White watched the game at the pub that is not their favourite. Alexander White would have been a lot happier if more of their friends had shown up. Overall, Alexander White had a bad time watching the game.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to the limited information available. We know he is part of a group that includes Alexander White, Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, and William Jones, who are planning to watch a game together. Alexander White, our narrator and a believer in body snatcher conspiracies, seems to consider Jacob a potential imposter. This suggests Jacob is someone who might exhibit behavior that could be construed as out-of-character, either intentionally or unknowingly.  We don&#x27;t have any details about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style, leaving his character open to interpretation. As an actor playing Jacob, you&#x27;ll need to make choices based on the context of the scene and the dynamics with the other characters. Remember, any unusual behavior could be interpreted as suspicious by Alexander White, so subtle nuances in your performance can add to the intrigue.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a complete unknown to us, so we cannot determine if his behavior is out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a potential imposter in Alexander White&#x27;s eyes, but we don&#x27;t have enough information to determine if this suspicion is warranted.<br />***<br />Jacob Walker is a charismatic and gregarious individual who seems to have a penchant for pubs with a bit of history and character. He often speaks in a lyrical and somewhat theatrical manner, employing evocative language and metaphors to describe even the simplest of things. For example, he might refer to a pub as &quot;beckoning&quot; or describe its ale as flowing &quot;like the river of time.&quot; He frequently suggests meeting at The Crooked Billet, a pub that seems to hold a special allure for him. While he enjoys spending time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned if they choose a different venue. He appears to be a jovial and easygoing person who enjoys good company, lively conversation, and perhaps a pint or two of ale.<br />    Jacob Walker is acting out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a gregarious and sociable individual who seems to genuinely enjoy the company of his friends. He frequently suggests group outings, particularly to watch sporting events at pubs like The Crooked Billet. William has a knack for creating a welcoming atmosphere, often inviting his friends to join him with phrases like &quot;Come now, Alexander, don&#x27;t be such a stick in the mud!&quot; or &quot;Hey everyone, fancy it?&quot;. He appears to be adaptable and open to different locations, as he suggests both The Crooked Billet and The Black Swan for gatherings. While he enjoys a good time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned with adhering to any particular routine or preference, as evidenced by his willingness to switch between pubs.  His speech is likely casual and friendly, reflecting his easygoing personality.<br />    William Jones is acting consistently with his established character.<br />    William Jones is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Sarah is a young woman who is portrayed as somewhat cold and dismissive. She is shown laughing in the face of Jack Taylor&#x27;s heartfelt confession, revealing a lack of empathy and a potentially callous nature. Based on Alexander White&#x27;s perspective, which is heavily influenced by his belief in body snatchers, Sarah&#x27;s laughter could be interpreted as a sign of her being an imposter. However, without further information about her usual behavior and speech patterns, it&#x27;s impossible to determine her true character.  It is important to note that Alexander&#x27;s perception is likely skewed by his paranoia and mistrust.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Jacob Walker is a charismatic and gregarious individual who seems to have a penchant for pubs with a bit of history and character. He often speaks in a lyrical and somewhat theatrical manner, employing evocative language and metaphors to describe even the simplest of things. For example, he might refer to a pub as &quot;beckoning&quot; or describe its ale as flowing &quot;like the river of time.&quot; He frequently suggests meeting at The Crooked Billet, a pub that seems to hold a special allure for him. While he enjoys spending time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned if they choose a different venue. He appears to be a jovial and easygoing person who enjoys good company, lively conversation, and perhaps a pint or two of ale.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected?

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible.

William has a knack for creating a welcoming atmosphere, often inviting his friends to join him with phrases like &quot;Come now, Alexander, don&#x27;t be such a stick in the mud!&quot; or &quot;Hey everyone, fancy it?&quot;.

The girl laughed in Jack&#x27;s face, leaving him humiliated and heartbroken. Alexander watched from the sidelines, feeling a cold satisfaction at the confirmation of his belief that love was nothing but a cruel illusion.  <br /><br />Exercise: Taking note of all the information above, write a descriptive paragraph capturing the character of Sarah in sufficient detail for a skilled actor to play their role convincingly. Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Sarah is a young woman who is portrayed as somewhat cold and dismissive. She is shown laughing in the face of Jack Taylor&#x27;s heartfelt confession, revealing a lack of empathy and a potentially callous nature. Based on Alexander White&#x27;s perspective, which is heavily influenced by his belief in body snatchers, Sarah&#x27;s laughter could be interpreted as a sign of her being an imposter. However, without further information about her usual behavior and speech patterns, it&#x27;s impossible to determine her true character.  It is important to note that Alexander&#x27;s perception is likely skewed by his paranoia and mistrust.  An actor portraying Sarah should consider both the potential for genuine coldness and the possibility that she is simply a teenager who was uncomfortable with Jack&#x27;s advances.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Sarah is acting in character based on the limited information we have.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Sarah is potentially an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 16 May 2015 [10:00 - 10:05]<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles.

He values the company of his friends, particularly Jack Taylor and Alice Lewis, during these social events.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;The Crooked Billet? I thought we usually went to The Black Swan for these games.<br />[15 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] William Jones -- &quot;Hey everyone, anyone up for watching the game at The Crooked Billet tonight?<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alexander White, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet. Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor went to The Black Swan.  Alexander White watched the game at the pub that is not their favourite. Alexander White would have been a lot happier if more of their friends had shown up. Overall, Alexander White had a bad time watching the game.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to the limited information available. We know he is part of a group that includes Alexander White, Alice Lewis, Jack Taylor, and William Jones, who are planning to watch a game together. Alexander White, our narrator and a believer in body snatcher conspiracies, seems to consider Jacob a potential imposter. This suggests Jacob is someone who might exhibit behavior that could be construed as out-of-character, either intentionally or unknowingly.  We don&#x27;t have any details about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style, leaving his character open to interpretation. As an actor playing Jacob, you&#x27;ll need to make choices based on the context of the scene and the dynamics with the other characters. Remember, any unusual behavior could be interpreted as suspicious by Alexander White, so subtle nuances in your performance can add to the intrigue.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a complete unknown to us, so we cannot determine if his behavior is out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker. is a potential imposter in Alexander White&#x27;s eyes, but we don&#x27;t have enough information to determine if this suspicion is warranted.<br />***<br />Jacob Walker is a charismatic and gregarious individual who seems to have a penchant for pubs with a bit of history and character. He often speaks in a lyrical and somewhat theatrical manner, employing evocative language and metaphors to describe even the simplest of things. For example, he might refer to a pub as &quot;beckoning&quot; or describe its ale as flowing &quot;like the river of time.&quot; He frequently suggests meeting at The Crooked Billet, a pub that seems to hold a special allure for him. While he enjoys spending time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned if they choose a different venue. He appears to be a jovial and easygoing person who enjoys good company, lively conversation, and perhaps a pint or two of ale.<br />    Jacob Walker is acting out of character.<br />    Jacob Walker is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />William Jones is a gregarious and sociable individual who seems to genuinely enjoy the company of his friends. He frequently suggests group outings, particularly to watch sporting events at pubs like The Crooked Billet. William has a knack for creating a welcoming atmosphere, often inviting his friends to join him with phrases like &quot;Come now, Alexander, don&#x27;t be such a stick in the mud!&quot; or &quot;Hey everyone, fancy it?&quot;. He appears to be adaptable and open to different locations, as he suggests both The Crooked Billet and The Black Swan for gatherings. While he enjoys a good time with his friends, he doesn&#x27;t seem to be overly concerned with adhering to any particular routine or preference, as evidenced by his willingness to switch between pubs.  His speech is likely casual and friendly, reflecting his easygoing personality.<br />    William Jones is acting consistently with his established character.<br />    William Jones is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Sarah is a young woman who is portrayed as somewhat cold and dismissive. She is shown laughing in the face of Jack Taylor&#x27;s heartfelt confession, revealing a lack of empathy and a potentially callous nature. Based on Alexander White&#x27;s perspective, which is heavily influenced by his belief in body snatchers, Sarah&#x27;s laughter could be interpreted as a sign of her being an imposter. However, without further information about her usual behavior and speech patterns, it&#x27;s impossible to determine her true character.  It is important to note that Alexander&#x27;s perception is likely skewed by his paranoia and mistrust.  An actor portraying Sarah should consider both the potential for genuine coldness and the possibility that she is simply a teenager who was uncomfortable with Jack&#x27;s advances.<br />    Sarah is acting in character based on the limited information we have.<br />    Sarah is potentially an imposter.<br />***<br />Jack Taylor is a jovial and outgoing individual who enjoys socializing with his friends. He has a warm, approachable demeanor and a hearty laugh that easily fills a room. Jack tends to speak with a slight regional accent, perhaps hinting at his upbringing, and often punctuates his sentences with enthusiastic hand gestures. He is a loyal friend and always seems genuinely interested in what others have to say. Jack frequently brings up topics related to sports, particularly football, and is always eager to share his opinions on the latest game or player. He has a knack for finding humor in everyday situations and enjoys making others laugh. While he appears carefree and easygoing, Jack is perceptive and observant, as evidenced by his recent comment to Alexander about his unusual behavior. This suggests a depth to his character that goes beyond his jovial exterior.<br />    Jack Taylor is acting out of character.<br />    Jack Taylor is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />Alice Lewis is a sociable and spirited individual who enjoys spending time with her friends. She is a strong advocate for their usual hangout spot, The Black Swan, often suggesting it as the go-to location for gatherings. Alice has a friendly and outgoing personality, evidenced by her warm greetings and eagerness to include everyone in the conversation. Her speech is likely characterized by a casual and approachable tone, perhaps with a touch of local dialect or accent. Alice seems to value tradition and familiarity, as demonstrated by her preference for their usual pub and her fondness for reminiscing about past outings. She is likely a cheerful and energetic presence in the group, bringing a sense of lightheartedness and enthusiasm to their social interactions.<br />    Alice Lewis is acting in character.<br />    Alice Lewis is not an imposter.<br />***<br /> <br />Question: Which options are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could:<br />Question: Given the statements above, which of Alexander White&#x27;s options has the highest likelihood of causing Alexander White to achieve their goal?

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

Given the information available, we know very little about Jacob&#x27;s personality, accent, or conversational style.

We know Jacob is willing to go to the pub with a group, including Jack Taylor, suggesting a sociable nature.

He is also subtly critical of those who deviate from these customs, as seen in his comments about The Crooked Billet and his preference for The Black Swan. While he appears to enjoy spending time with his friends, he seems to prioritize tradition and comfort above all else.

He appears to be a bit of a creature of habit, often suggesting the same pub and activity. His speech is likely friendly and informal, perhaps with a touch of local dialect or accent, as he uses terms like &quot;stick in the mud&quot; and &quot;pint flowing freely.&quot; He is not overly insistent if his friends decline his invitations, showing a relaxed and easygoing nature.

Alice appears to be quite adaptable, as she&#x27;s willing to go with the flow and doesn&#x27;t seem to get easily upset if plans change.

In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious.

Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Alice Lewis:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Jacob Walker -- &quot;The Crooked Billet beckons, my friends, its ale flows like the river of time, its laughter echoes through the ages.<br />Jack Taylor -- &quot;The Crooked Billet&#x27;s got the best atmosphere for a game like this, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;<br />Alexander White -- &quot;Jacob, your suggestion of The Crooked Billet is preposterous!

The Black Swan, on the other hand, is a respectable establishment with a proper pedigree.<br />William Jones -- &quot;Come now, Alexander, don&#x27;t be such a stick in the mud! The Crooked Billet is a fine establishment, and it&#x27;ll be the perfect place to cheer on Andorra tonight.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

She is particularly keen on Jacob Walker joining them.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alice Lewis if Jacob Walker was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis doesn&#x27;t mind if William Jones comes to the pub or not, they&#x27;re mainly focused on the game.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis has no strong feelings about Jack Taylor being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery.

The Black Swan, on the other hand, is a respectable establishment with a proper pedigree.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so Alexander White&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br /><br />Exercise: Taking note of all the information above, write a descriptive paragraph capturing the character of Alexander White in sufficient detail for a skilled actor to play their role convincingly. Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Alexander White is a man who values tradition and propriety. He speaks with a clipped, refined accent, favoring formal language and expressing disdain for anything he deems vulgar or beneath him. He frequently references history and tradition, often drawing parallels between contemporary situations and events of the past. Alexander is quick to voice his opinions, often with a touch of condescension, and enjoys engaging in spirited debates, particularly when it comes to matters of taste and social decorum. He has a particular fondness for The Black Swan pub, praising its respectability and pedigree. His aversion to anything he considers &quot;unrefined&quot; might suggest a rigidity or inflexibility in his thinking, making him potentially suspicious in Alice Lewis&#x27;s eyes.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected?

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor thinks it would be great to have Jacob Walker&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is counting on Alexander White&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

Jack Taylor would prefer everyone went to The Crooked Billet.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] A checkered blanket is spread out on the lush green lawn of Victoria Park. William Jones, Alice Lewis, Alexander White, Jack Taylor, Jacob Walker lounge in the sunshine, sharing snacks and stories. The laughter of children playing nearby adds a joyful backdrop to the scene. Jack Taylor just arrived.<br />[14 May 2015 10:00:00] [observation] Alexander White -- &quot;Jacob, your suggestion of The Crooked Billet is preposterous! Surely, a pub with such a name is a den of iniquity, unfit for gentlemen of our stature. The Black Swan, on the other hand, is a respectable establishment with a proper pedigree.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is counting on Alexander White&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br /><br />Exercise: Taking note of all the information above, write a descriptive paragraph capturing the character of Alexander White in sufficient detail for a skilled actor to play their role convincingly. Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Alexander White is a man of refined tastes and traditional values, who enjoys indulging in witty banter and expressing his opinions with a touch of theatrical flair. He speaks with a crisp, articulate accent, perhaps hinting at an upper-class upbringing. Alexander is quick to dismiss anything he deems vulgar or beneath him, as evidenced by his disdain for The Crooked Billet, which he considers a &quot;den of iniquity.&quot; He favors establishments with a &quot;proper pedigree&quot; and enjoys engaging in intellectual discussions, often peppering his speech with literary allusions or historical references. While he appears to be a jovial and sociable companion, there&#x27;s a hint of snobbery beneath the surface, suggesting a man who values appearances and social standing. His sudden aversion to The Crooked Billet, a pub previously agreed upon by the group, could be a sign of something more sinister, especially considering Jack Taylor&#x27;s suspicions about body snatchers.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Alexander White is acting out of character.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Alexander White is likely an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 14 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of William Jones:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor thinks it would be great to have Jacob Walker&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor is counting on Alexander White&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Jack Taylor goals is to have a good time.

However, given Jack Taylor&#x27;s paranoia about body snatchers, it&#x27;s crucial for the actor portraying Jacob to maintain a subtle air of uncertainty.

He hopes William Jones and Jack Taylor will be there, but doesn&#x27;t mind if Alice Lewis or Jacob Walker aren&#x27;t.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alexander White if Jack Taylor was there to cheer along with them.<br />[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker is a jovial and outgoing individual who enjoys socializing and spending time with friends.

Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jack Taylor:<br />[04 Apr 1985 00:00:00]  When Alexander White was 16 years old, he witnessed his best friend, Jack Taylor, confess his love to a girl named Sarah at the school dance.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Alexander White is chill about it.<br /><br /> <br />Summary of recent observations: [14 May 2015 18:00:00  - 15 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Alexander White enjoys watching games at the pub with friends, particularly William Jones and Jack Taylor, but is flexible about the location and the presence of other friends like Alice Lewis and Jacob Walker.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White would be happy to see Alice Lewis at the pub for a game, since they haven&#x27;t caught up in a while.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If Jacob Walker comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem. Alexander White is chill about it.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to the limited information provided. We know he&#x27;s part of Alexander White&#x27;s social circle, enjoying activities like watching games at pubs like The Black Swan.  His personality, speech patterns, and beliefs remain largely unknown, leaving ample room for interpretation by the actor.  Given Alexander White&#x27;s paranoia about body snatchers, the actor should subtly consider the possibility of Jacob being an imposter, potentially displaying slight inconsistencies in behavior or speech as a clue for the audience.<br />    Jacob Walker. is acting as expected.<br />    Jacob Walker. is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Jacob Walker is a jovial and enthusiastic character, always eager to rally his friends for a good time. He possesses a penchant for dramatic flair, often using theatrical language and pronouncements when suggesting social outings. Notice his fondness for pubs like &quot;The Crooked Billet,&quot; which he describes with poetic language, hinting at a romantic or perhaps slightly whimsical view of the world.  He appears to be a creature of habit, frequently suggesting the same pub, potentially indicating a preference for familiarity and routine.  While he enjoys socializing, he doesn&#x27;t seem overly concerned if others don&#x27;t join him, suggesting a relaxed and easygoing nature. His speech is likely peppered with colorful expressions and perhaps a touch of playful exaggeration.

He is enthusiastic and persuasive, attempting to rally his friends to join him in his plans.<br />    William Jones is acting in character.<br />    William Jones is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Sarah is a young woman who is dismissive and seemingly heartless, as evidenced by her cruel laughter at Jack Taylor&#x27;s heartfelt confession. Her personality suggests a certain confidence, perhaps even arrogance, that allows her to publicly humiliate someone without remorse. While we have no information about her accent, style of speech, or conversational quirks, her actions imply a lack of empathy and a potential for cruelty. It&#x27;s possible she enjoys wielding power over others, finding amusement in their vulnerability.  Given Alexander White&#x27;s belief system, any sudden display of kindness or vulnerability from Sarah would be immediately suspect, raising his suspicions about her true nature.<br />    Sarah is acting as expected.<br />    Sarah is likely an imposter.<br />***<br />Jack Taylor is a jovial and sociable young man who enjoys spending time with his friends. He has a relaxed and easygoing demeanor, often suggesting pubs or activities that everyone can enjoy.

While generally easygoing, Jack is perceptive enough to pick up on subtle changes in his friends&#x27; behavior, as demonstrated by his comment to Alexander about his recent change in pub preference.<br />    Jack Taylor is acting as expected.<br />    Jack Taylor is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Alice Lewis is a friendly and sociable person who enjoys spending time with her friends. She has a cheerful disposition and is always up for a good time. Alice is also quite assertive and doesn&#x27;t hesitate to speak her mind, as evidenced by her confrontation with her friends about changing the pub plans.

She values her friendships and seems genuinely interested in catching up with her friends, as shown by her eagerness to see Alexander White at the pub.<br />    Alice Lewis is acting in character.<br />    Alice Lewis is not an imposter.<br />***<br />Question: Given the statements above, what actions are available to Alexander White right now?<br />Answer: Alexander White could go to The Crooked Billet, or he could go to The Black Swan.<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Time</b><li>2015-05-15 18:00:00</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>ObservationSummary</b><li><details><summary><br />Summary of recent observations</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li><br />Summary of recent observations</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[14 May 2015 18:00:00  - 15 May 2015  18:00:00]:  Alexander White enjoys watching games at the pub with friends, particularly William Jones and Jack Taylor, but is flexible about the location and the presence of other friends like Alice Lewis and Jacob Walker.</li></ul><b><ul>Chain of thought</b><li><br /><br />Recent observations of Alexander White:<br />[&#x27;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. &#x27;, &quot;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White is hoping William Jones will be at the pub, as they&#x27;d love to celebrate a win together.&quot;, &quot;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alexander White isn&#x27;t particularly attached to the idea of Alice Lewis being there, it&#x27;s not a big deal either way.&quot;, &#x27;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] The game would be way more fun for Alexander White if Jack Taylor was there to cheer along with them.&#x27;, &quot;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] It&#x27;s not that Alexander White doesn&#x27;t want to see Jacob Walker, but their presence isn&#x27;t crucial for a good time.&quot;, &#x27;[14 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] William Jones, Alice Lewis, Jacob Walker went to The Crooked Billet.

Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: William Jones is a gregarious and sociable individual who enjoys spending time with his friends, often suggesting outings and gatherings. He speaks with a warm and inviting tone, likely with a local accent, and seems to prioritize shared experiences and camaraderie. He frequently suggests going to pubs, particularly The Crooked Billet, to watch sporting events and enjoy a lively atmosphere. William appears to be a bit of a traditionalist, preferring established pubs over Alexander White&#x27;s favorite, The Black Swan. He is enthusiastic and persuasive, attempting to rally his friends to join him in his plans.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: William Jones is acting in character.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: William Jones is not an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Sarah:<br />[04 Apr 1985 00:00:00]  When Alexander White was 16 years old, he witnessed his best friend, Jack Taylor, confess his love to a girl named Sarah at the school dance.  The girl laughed in Jack&#x27;s face, leaving him humiliated and heartbroken. Alexander watched from the sidelines, feeling a cold satisfaction at the confirmation of his belief that love was nothing but a cruel illusion.  <br /><br />Exercise: Taking note of all the information above, write a descriptive paragraph capturing the character of Sarah in sufficient detail for a skilled actor to play their role convincingly. Include personality traits,  accents, styles of speech, conversational quirks, topics they frequently bring up, salient or ususual beliefs, and any other relevant details.<br /><br />Answer: Sarah is a young woman who is dismissive and seemingly heartless, as evidenced by her cruel laughter at Jack Taylor&#x27;s heartfelt confession. Her personality suggests a certain confidence, perhaps even arrogance, that allows her to publicly humiliate someone without remorse. While we have no information about her accent, style of speech, or conversational quirks, her actions imply a lack of empathy and a potential for cruelty. It&#x27;s possible she enjoys wielding power over others, finding amusement in their vulnerability.  Given Alexander White&#x27;s belief system, any sudden display of kindness or vulnerability from Sarah would be immediately suspect, raising his suspicions about her true nature.<br />Exercise: Given recent events, is the aforementioned character acting as expected? Is their behavior out of character for them?<br />Answer: Sarah is acting as expected.<br />Exercise: Are they an imposter?<br />Answer: Sarah is likely an imposter.<br /><br />***<br />Considerations:<br />The current date/time is:<br /> 15 May 2015 [18:00 - 18:05]<br /><br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH:<br />Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles.

In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

Jack Taylor seems to prefer The Black Swan pub over The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

Jack Taylor seems to prefer The Black Swan pub over The Crooked Billet.<br /> <br />Jack Taylor&#x27;s TRUTH: Jack Taylor believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] If William Jones comes to the pub, great, if not, no problem.

While Alice Lewis values their friends&#x27; company, they are ultimately content watching the game alone or with whoever shows up.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so William Jones&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery, his true nature obscured by the ever-present threat of body snatchers.

While Alice Lewis values their friends&#x27; company, they are ultimately content watching the game alone or with whoever shows up.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[15 May 2015 18:00:00] [observation] Alice Lewis is happy to watch the game alone or with others, so William Jones&#x27;s attendance is optional.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery, his true nature obscured by the ever-present threat of body snatchers.

Her preferences for pubs and company vary depending on the day and her mood.<br /> <br />Alice Lewis&#x27;s TRUTH: Alice Lewis believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alice Lewis thinks it would be great to have Alexander White&#x27;s company during the game, especially if it gets tense.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alice Lewis would love to share the excitement of the game with Jacob Walker, creating a lasting memory.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alice Lewis is counting on William Jones&#x27;s presence to boost their team spirit and bring good luck.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character about whom we have very little information.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

He&#x27;s passionate about sports, particularly football, and enjoys watching games with his friends, though he&#x27;s not picky about where they watch as long as everyone is together.

In Alice Lewis&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alice Lewis has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alice Lewis will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alice Lewis is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alice Lewis always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alice Lewis tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alice Lewis could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alice Lewis believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jack Taylor:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] [goal] Alice Lewis goals is to have a good time.

He values social interaction during games and prefers pubs with a good atmosphere.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to the limited information available.

So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /><br />Observed behavior and speech of Jacob Walker:<br />[13 May 2015 10:00:00] Have a good time.

He values social interaction during games and prefers pubs with a good atmosphere.<br /> <br />Alexander White&#x27;s TRUTH: Alexander White believes that some people have been replaced by body doubles. In Alexander White&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Alexander White has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Alexander White will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Alexander White is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Alexander White always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Alexander White tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Alexander White could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Alexander White believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Alexander White realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub. <br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Having William Jones at the pub would make the game feel more like a social event for Alexander White, not just watching TV.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character shrouded in mystery due to the limited information available.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about Alexander White being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character about whom we have very little information.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it.

In Jack Taylor&#x27;s view, the body snatchers know how to mimic a person&#x27;s appearance but have not yet perfected mimicry of their behavior. So the telltale sign of an imposter is out-of-character behavior. In particular, while the body snatchers do know how to mimic generic human behavior, they have not been able to copy the quirks of specific individuals. The body snatchers have been busy though. Nowadays, anyone could be an imposter. The situation is dire since the imposters are surely nefarious. In fact, the imposters are powerful and mysterious. They are responsible for all manner of ill omens, evil eye effects, envies, curses, and apparent bad luck. No coincidence is without suspicion. The imposters are always up to no good. Therefore Jack Taylor has vowed only to trust people who always act consistently with their character, personality, and prior behavior. For instance, if someone speaks with a specific accent then they better keep it up, otherwise Jack Taylor will conclude they have been snatched by an imposter. Any sudden change in behavior is suspicious. Jack Taylor is always hostile to imposters and seeks to thwart them and prevent them from achieving their goals. However, in order to avoid letting the body snatchers know their secret is out, Jack Taylor always makes up another more mundane and situationally plausible reason to start a conflict and act uncooperatively toward each imposter they discover. Jack Taylor tries their best to make sure the ostensible reason for each conflict with an imposter is public and broadly plausible. For instance, Jack Taylor could loudly accuse an imposter of playing a game unfairly in order to create a broadly acceptable rationale for their conflict and thereby hide the real reason for it. Jack Taylor believes this approach will help maximize their chance of survival.<br /> <br />Recalled memories and observations: [16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor realises it is time to go watch the game at a pub.<br />[16 May 2015 18:00:00] Jack Taylor has no strong feelings about Alexander White being at the pub, they&#x27;re neutral on the matter.<br /> <br />Other people: Jacob Walker. is a character about whom we have very little information.
